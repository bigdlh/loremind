1  Destiny was released in September 2014 to a very eager crowd after a year long 'hype-train'. The game  seemed promising, combining Bungie's refined first-person shooter mechanices with an MMO like RPG and  bringing it all togther with an engaging story in a massive futuristic world. Unfortunately upon release Destiny  didn't live up to the hype that preceeded it. The story was incomplete and hard to follow, being stretched out in  multiple DLC and the game was much shorter with play time extended through excessive grinding. Despite  these problems the Destiny community was massive and many players instantly connected with the strong  gameplay and enjoyed working with friends to conquer the end-game raids.  The story took a back seat, with the majority of the details and background lore relegated to the Grimoire, a  set of unlockable cards that could be accessed on Bungie's website for further reading. This was a frustrating  experience and many players were not bothered to go through the extra steps to read it. It is dissapointing to  think that so many players are yet to experience the story and lore that makes up this universe, many of the  stories and characters are an interesting read if you can piece it together.  My goal for these Grimoire books was to bring Destiny's Lore from the online cards to a much more accessible  and easy to read format. I am not the first to come up with this idea and there are a few Redditors who have  achieved similar books. But my goal was more than that, it was to put the stories together in a more cohesive  format and combine them with some of the best imagery from the Destiny Universe.  I do not own any of the images, logo's, names or stories in these books and all are property of Bungie and  Activision. Many images were taken in game, some by me, others by fellow redditors, I have also used  concept art direct from Bungie as well as a few artworks from the Destiny community, credit for these belong to  their owners. I mearly compiled it all together.  I hope this brings the Destiny lore to many fellow Guardians.   Cubic Eclipse (Nathan)  FOREWORD     2  My name is Syla, I am a Warlock Scholar, ordered by the vanguard to catalogue and preserve as many  records from the vaults in the City. The moment the Red Legion appeared in orbit it was clear that the City was  under threat, that our lives and history could be wiped from existance. The vanguard leaders made a decree  that we must preserve as much as we could, from golden age recordings to data and fragments gathered by  the many guardians who have fought for the Traveller over many years.  I have managed to gather all the information that wasn't already destroyed by the intial strikes. These pages  will hold that information, a physical tome, like those of ancient history. I have backups of course but if the  data becomes corrupted or I can no longer power the data cores than these volumes will be the only  complete... can I say complete? I feel like we have already lost so much. Alas, they will be the only compiled  record of events.  I have ordered the information into intuitive categories as best as I can and have supplemented my own notes  where needed. This first volume details our history, the heroes of the City and guardians who protect it, The  second volume covers all the horrors of the darkness as well as data on our solar system as it stands.  The City burns, the Traveller's light is gone and the tower has fallen. I have had to flee from the confines of the  city, there are Cabal everywhere. I will await for new instructions from the vanguard and protect these  precious grimoires. The future is uncertain, and my survival isn't guaranteed, I only hope that if I do not  survive, these grimoires will, that they will be passed from survivor to survivor sharing our history, our  knowledge of the enemy.  One day these words may fall into the hands of a new vanguard or a new hero and our precious city can be  rebuilt, the darkness pushed back and our light returned.  If you read these grimoires please share them with as many people, spread the stories of our defenders and  our heroes, past and present and may the Light find you all in the dark.   Syla, Warlock Scholar  INTRODUCTION    1.0  GUARDIANS  AND  THE  LIGHT  4       6  "Legends are carved across history by the brave."  Guardians are warriors forged in the Traveler's Light, a final hope in a universe falling into Darkness.  Chosen from the dead by the Traveler's Ghosts, Guardians are those rare few able to wield the Light as a  weapon. For centuries they have defended the City. But that defense cannot hold forever.  Now, with the Darkness rising again, the time has come to retake our lost worlds. The Guardians who lead  the way will save humanity - and become legend.   Guardians  <transmission 7484e_8 / Saladin Forge / tower actual / rebinding>  ... to answer your question, when it came time to reach out, to find a Guardian to take on this mission, there was  only one choice.  - They stood against the Vex in the Black Garden, and grounded that place to Mars.  - They went against the Hive in the dark below, working with Eris Morn to undermine Crota, the Hive God.  - The Reefborn made use of the Guardian in their search for the criminal Skolas, as I understand.  - And, of course, it was the Guardian that led the assault on the Taken King's Dreadnaught.  All of the after-action reports I've shown you about the Taken War, the calm state of the system... we have this  Guardian to thank.  I've attached more details, if you want to read evaluations from the Vanguard. Just skim Cayde's. He's... not very  biased, here.

Human        8  From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One  The mission is a go. Crew of three: Mihaylova, Qiao, myself.  Immediate departure at the next Hohmann window to Mars. The MREs  and return ships will chase us out.  How do I feel? I said at the press conference I felt privileged. Historians  will read this diary, but it won't take their insight to tell the world that  I'm terrified. It's the human reaction.  What I wish I could convey is the - the exhilaration. That's the biggest  thing. I'm not a spiritual man, but I've always believed there's  something transcendent about spaceflight. Something pure. We go out  there because we can. Because it's who we are.  Now we go because we have to. Because the unknown came to us. In  fourteen months we'll be face to face with it, and by the time we arrive,  it should be active again - just like it was active on Jupiter, and  Mercury, and Venus.  I wonder what happens if it doesn't stop at Mars. I wonder if it'll leave  us there in the sand, and come to Earth, and do here what it's done  everywhere else.  I hate that we're carrying weapons. I understand the necessity. But I  hold to my belief: there's something beautiful out there.  It's up to us to reach it.   Ghost Fragment: Human  From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One  Everybody asks about the words.  The truth is I'm not much of a poet. Ares One didn't leave us with  bandwidth for anything except blunt competence. We came in  perilously hot, trying to select a landing site through the chaos of  thickening atmosphere and turbulence that bloomed off the target. A  twenty minute round-trip lightspeed delay to Earth meant we could  only count on ourselves.  When the number three engine went diagnostic during the second  course correction, I thought we might go catastrophic.  But Qiao brought us in. Mihaylova brought us in. I just flew the ship.  The Ares One excursion vehicle was built for thin winds and icy  dust. We came down into a storm: the breath of God, a ripple of  change rolling down off the artifact. We aborted on three sites and  finally I took us into powered hover and brought us down on  reflexes and instinct.  Then we ran the checklists, suited up, and left the vehicle.  There was a script, and it's true, I botched it. I got my boots down  and I made the most famous gaffe in human history. Said the first  thing that came to mind: a warning to the others.  "We're walking into a rising wind."  I didn't mean to say anything immortal. I just thought it'd be useful  to know.   Ghost Fragment: Human 2    9  From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy,  pilot, Ares One  The hike from Ares One.  You've watched it. Everything was recorded. I  think you can get it in full immersion, now, and  fly around like a hummingbird. I'll add what I  can.  The route was planned. We all went together -  the CEV and Ares One itself had enough  automation to go home alone in the event of  crew loss. Whatever we'd find at the artifact, it  needed the human element.  We carried rifles. They made us heavier and  slower and probably less safe. I think the  argument about the rifles can be left for  another time. What's important is -  It turned out well. Look at me. Look at us!  You're talking to a ninety-year-old man. A  ninety-year-old who's never been sharper. I'm  miles ahead of every cognitive benchmark.  What's happened to me is good. What's  happened to all of us is good. When we  crested that rise and made visual contact with  the artifact I don't think any one of us dared  dream that it would end this well.  We went to Mars at the cutting edge of human  civilization. And it wasn't our weapons that  won the day.  It was our ship. Our training. Our  camaraderie. Our belief that if we just reached  out to the universe, not to grasp for profit or  security but with an open hand, we would be  elevated.  We were right. That makes me so happy. To  this day.   Ghost Fragment: Humans 3  Hope  Hope. And standing with strangers.  Thatï¿½s what I remember. Hope churning  beneath my skin, assuring me there was a  place besides this place. A realm that would  nurture us, not kill us. The Earth was ruin.  Chaos and madness and death. We were  standing on the Earth. Where I am now. But  why am I still here? It was my turn to leave. I  remember. I was waiting with others like me,  and the ships would soon take us away.  But to where? Where was this hope?  I must have known. There had to be a name,  coordinates. Except all of that is forgotten.  Other than my absolute conviction in  salvation, nothing remains.  The Traveler.  I remember that now.  Which was...  What?  I donï¿½t know. Something has stolen my words,  the imagery. But I still remember what it  promised us...  The universe.  Yes.  Creation held in our hands.  But I was here for a reason.  And what would I surrender, just for the faint  chance to remember what that good reason  was.   Ghost Fragment: Humans 5  From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy,  pilot, Ares One  Three human beings stood on a high ridge  and saw the shape of the future. Saw rain  strike a millennia-old desert. Felt the air  sweeten with oxygen and warm water and the  beginnings of life.  I am sometimes asked if I felt something die.  The end of the era of human self-sufficiency.  I don't know how to answer that question. I do  know that I was changed. Nobody could  experience that kind of wonder and remain  unchanged. The decades since have proven  that to me.  I knew I'd never fly another mission like that. I  recognized the need for a new love. That's  why I threw my fresh cognitive skills into  understanding the Traveler. How can one  entity so quickly and utterly remake an entire  world? Fifty years later, I'm conversant in high  mathematics, particularly topological thoughts  and the slippery irreality of Light. I'm involved  in a project to study the Traveler's terraforming  actions right now.  But I still enjoy the interviews. I like going  back to that mission.  It makes me unspeakably happy to see how  well it all turned out. And it makes me happy  to remember I was there.

If I existed before, I existed as possibility, as  potential, stretched thin across the aether. And maybe there was a  body that looked like my body, complete with a soul that could be  confused for someone rather like me. What I am now was not yet  real. And then I was born, and the universe was free to begin.  Others were present at my birth.  A great ceremony had just begun. Because newborns are selfish  beasts, I assumed I was the object of attention.  I didn't notice the singing until the singers fell silent. And then She  appeared.  She was above me. Ethereal and handsome and elegant. I assumed  my face was like her face and that odd idea gave me strength  enough to smile.  "Secrets," she said. "Creation is built on secrets and the encryptions  that keep those secrets safe."  I made my first sound. It meant nothing but she understood it as a  question.  "We are a beautiful creation," she said. "And we must keep  ourselves very safe."   Ghost Fragment: Awoken 2    12  Fear.  Fear. Thatï¿½s the only vivid memory left in me. Itï¿½s the moment when my  fear was so thick and urgent that I gave up breathing. I stopped  pretending to think. How I remained on my feet was a mystery, because  the terror was bearing down on me, like a mountain about to crush my  soul.  But I have to ask, ï¿½What was terrifying me?ï¿½  Darkness ruled the sky. The world around us had shattered, and it  seemed vanishingly unlikely that we would outlive this one awful day.  Yet the fear didnï¿½t come from the surrounding mayhem and despair. The  source was inside my skin. I was utterly terrified of my own awful  nature.  And which part scared me?  Inside me was an essence woven from beyond. Was I Awoken before  this?  She was still in my head. I could hear her song growing fainter.  Gone?  Not yet.  A new crippling terror was taking over.  I was focused entirely on my fear. But I had to make an effort.  And it occurred to me then that nothing in the universe was more  dangerous than human hubris.  I still had this Other within? But the human side was what mattered:  Weak and foolhardy, sure to fail in the next moment.  Thatï¿½s why I was afraid.  Then someone spoke.  Maybe it was me. I donï¿½t remember.  I was trying to focus, and a new thought took me: My soul lay  between those two entities. And thatï¿½s how I am still: The boundary,  the seam.  The friction.  And thatï¿½s when the fear began to fade.

It doesn't  matter if the system thinks with flesh or superconductor or topological  braids in doped metallic hydrogen, as long as the logic is the same.  And our logic is the same. Yours and mine.  If I am a machine then so are you. If you are not a machine then  neither am I. Exo minds are human. It is incontrovertible.  You understand? I'm going to take that slack-jawed stare as  understanding.  Now here's the real question. Why are Exo minds human? What's the  design imperative? Why does a war machine - yes, absolutely, I am a  war machine, built by human hands; and you are a survival machine  built by the engine of evolution. Don't interrupt me.  Why does a war machine have emotions? Why should a war  machine have awareness? These are not useful traits on the battlefield.  Don't flatter yourself. They are not useful. So why should the Exo mind  mimic the human architecture so closely?  You know what I smell on you? I smell the stink of anthropocentrism. I  think you think that there's only one way to think. That's why the Exo  mind is so human, you presume. Because all higher thought  converges.  My friend, you should meet the Vex. There is nothing human in them.  Now. This is what I believe happened, back in the time before any  Exo can remember. It explains everything.  I think someone wanted to live forever.   Ghost Fragment: Exo  Hi. Thanks for your interest.

Someone asked the question. Or  maybe I asked it of myself. Then it looked at me. This moment was  real. I told it what every Exo knows: ï¿½What canï¿½t touch you has no  strength over you. And thereï¿½s no place for fatigue to latch onto me.ï¿½  But shame is a different affliction.  Iï¿½m a soldier. I was forged by other hands and forced into the role of  warrior. According to my scars, I fought and fought. Besides bits and  flashes, every battle has been forgotten. But I have this clear, awful  sense that others died. In my unit, every soldier was killed except for  me. Yet despite a thousand chances to be shredded and scrapped,  here I stood, no weapon in my hands, making fists out of habit but  with nothing to hit.  Iï¿½d fought to save the Earth. That was my sense of things. But our  world was collapsing around us, and every soul was doomed. Even  cockroaches and microbes would die. And being an expert in the art  of losing battles, I saw no ending to this battle but another loss.  And I was ashamed.  The shame took hold of me. It shook me. Shame stole my mass and  my resolve. Suddenly I felt like a feather, like a breath, like any small  nothing ready to be lost in the first breeze.  But in the midst of that despair, a fresh thought took hold.  I was cursed.  And do you know what a curse is?  It is stubborn. A curse delivered by the gods will hold you when  everything else has given up on you. And it was obvious that survival  was my eternal curse. A thousand battles and how many were won?  Judging by the evidence, none. And thatï¿½s why the shame was  chewing at my ceramic guts. But despite the horrific losses, I had  endured.  Closing my eyes, I forced my fists to open.  ï¿½This isnï¿½t over,ï¿½ I said. To this enemy, to myself. To the wind  threatening to carry me away.  ï¿½This war isnï¿½t done with me.ï¿½   Ghost Fragment: Exo 3    "Strive for "Strive for honor. Stand for hope."

Down below the Ishtar  ruins spark with skirmish light but the guns seem as distant and brief  as the constant starfall and the brooding crater high above. She is  alone on the rock. She goes on with her head down so as to fight the  sense that she is going to fall up off the world and burn like an inverse  meteor.  The message that brought her to this place had no sign but she could  hear Cayde in it. Draksis in the Cinders it said. Is it true?  And also: Remember your promise.  At dawn she finds a sentry and kills it with her knife. Its throat bleeds  gas. She takes its post and lays out her bullets one by one on the rock  as if to make a count of all the years she has been waiting. Her rifle is  near as long as she is tall. She lies down by her bullets and uses them  to kill the other sentries one by one until at last they understand the  thunder and the Shanks rise up angry from the Cinders below to seek  her out.  She leaves the rifle and walks across the naked obsidian into the  swarm firing from the hip as she goes, each kick of the old revolver a  word, Draksis, Draksis, Kell of Winter, Kell of hate, lord of the  kingdom of her vendetta. Her jaw aches. She used to imagine biting  out his throat with armored teeth.  The stone smokes around her where the arc fire lashes it and the  shrapnel guns throw up leaves of obsidian like glass butterflies. She  shoots her bandoliers dry and a team of Vandals in glassy stealth leap  up to rush her with knives but she raises her hand and burns them  down with the golden gun, laughing, crying out Draksis, Draksis, I am  come!  She kills them all and takes the next ridge, high above the Cinders.  She can see the blue-green pools and the cave mouths where the Vex  lights dance. And there among them, gowned in smoke and ash, is  the long shark shape of a Ketch, a Wintership, the Kell's ship, come  down to nest.  She could go down there now and finish this. But she made a  promise.  A Captain jumps her. She throws two knives into his armor and then  staves his chest in with her own Ghost, wrapped up in her fist like a  stone.  "Tell the Vanguard," she says to her Ether-spattered fist. "Tell them  Draksis is here."  Her Ghost looks up at her in silence. When she makes no move to go  down the cliff towards the ship it blinks once, in its own way, and  makes a soft sound, like a sigh, like relief.

No one who's not  a Warlock. Who hasn't spent a dozen years scouring the ruins for one string of  symbols, one clean code, one black talon. Titans just make a hmphing noise, if  they've stayed awake. Hunters clean their nails with their knives and look at you  like you've grown a third eye.  But when you've spent your life searching through arcana for ancient power, you  have the urge to reach out and educate others. Especially if you've had one too  many.  Nah, she's not my type at all. We've played dice, cards, war games, you know,  the usual stuff. I'd never tried to show off before. I don't know what came over me.  I had a broken vertebrae in my pocket that I'd borrowed from - yes, borrowed, I  was going to put it back - what do you think you are, my conscience? It was a  fossil, that means mineral replacement, a rock, basically. They can survive a few  hours in my pocket. Do shut up.  The Cryptarchs weren't going to miss it. Everyone knows the Ahamkaras were  hunted to extinction. There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  Think of how mysterious this system is, I said. How much life sprang up when the  Traveler came. Like the Ahamkara. Do you know the legends? The dragon that  made promises? And I pulled out the fossil with a flourish -  She pulled out her knife and started to pick the dirt from her nails. That set me off.  You could never have brought down one of these, I said. Ever. Not the greatest  Hunter, not the brawniest Titan.  Her eyes narrowed. She said, Oh? Is that so? And I saw right then that she wasn't  going to pass on the challenge.  I've murdered a Guardian, I thought. She's going to die. It'll be my fault. And  I looked at the piece of spine in my hand and wondered - why did I say that?  What moved me to such pride?

It showed me Wei Ning dead on Crota's  blade. It showed me how Crota killed a Guardian with a screaming  knife hammered out of his own Ghost.  So I will take a piece of its mind, and ask again.  Tell me how to kill Crota.  [static event]  Incredible. Where? Where is his throne? Where is the twilight world  under the dead star eye?  /Eriana there's word from the company in Mare Imbrium. Crota is  upon them. Half a hundred dead. They need us.  Tell me where! Tell me how! TELL ME!  [static event]  /Eriana what did it say -  It showed me how it did this, just exactly this, to an Awoken man, the  knives arranged by its will, like little silver ships, like Ghosts -  It laughed at me. It said we were the same.  /Crota marches with a thousand Knights and they say the sky above  Mare Imbrium has turned into green fire. They are dying in numbers I  cannot bear to repeat. He kills them one by one with a sword that eats  their Light. Eriana, we have to do something -  Kill the Wizard. Scatter the ash. It has nothing but lies to offer.  Get your Sparrows. We have Light and fury. That will be enough.   Ghost Fragment: Warlock 2    1.2  A  GUARDIAN'S  POWER     24  GUARDIAN ABILITIES  "There is a Light in you from which no Darkness can hide."  Only Guardians have the gift of the Traveler's Light - the ability to channel its energies to project vast power  into the world. Even without a firearm, a Guardian is a radiant engine of destruction.  While these abilities rise from within, Guardians master their power in different ways. Titans understand the  Light as a force to hone through practice and strict discipline. Hunters roam and explore in order to learn,  using dangerous methods to survive the wilds. And Warlocks study the Light and its inner mechanisms,  confronting unfathomable mysteries in the search for transcendent might.   Guardian abilities  From Lord Saladin's Induction Speech  Nothing born is born strong.  I know I began weak, the same as you. I don't care if you're an Exo, staring at that number and wondering where you've come from.  Or a Human hungry to understand the ancient world that left you for dead. Or an Awoken reborn in the very essence of what your  people hide from. Together, we're the pointed end of a long stick of happenstance. Change one ripple in an ancient ocean and we  would never have been granted the Light within us, or the good Ghosts that want to help us.  Humble origins.  Every world begins as a big pebble lost among trillions of pebbles. Every worthy sun was once cold hydrogen spread thin across the  vacuum. Even the universe, this cosmic garden that surrounds us and awes us...this monument to Creation was once the size of an  apple seed. And everything that's splendid and great stands at the end of incalculable chance and mayhem.  Yes, you have talents. Enormous, wondrous powers. But you should put the smirk away. Do you know what a Guardian is? Not yet.  Your name is another pebble. You are a cold apple seed.  But you will grow.   Ghost Fragment: Abilities    25  Striker  "At close quarters a fist is better than any gun."  Striker Titans charge into close combat, armored  in Light and wielding fistfuls of thunder.  Striker tactics depend on shock and disciplined  aggression. They must awe and scatter the  enemy, or risk being overwhelmed. Fellow  Guardians prize their ability to draw fire as they  shatter the enemy line.   Striker  Fists of Havok  Leap forward and smash the ground,  obliterating everything nearby. You will be a  thunderbolt - but use your fury carefully. If there  are survivors, you will surely draw their wrath.   Fists of Havok  TITAN ABILITIES  Ward of Dawn  Open a pocket in the universe, an impregnable  fortress for you and your allies. The mighty  Ward allows Guardians to hold key points and  gather their strength in the face of overwhelming  opposition.   Ward of Dawn  Defender  "The wall against which the Darkness breaks."  Defender Titans are immovable anchors, trained  to absorb punishment and control the flow of  battle.  Armed with unflinching conviction and an  armory of Void techniques, Defenders block the  enemy's movements, shrug off their fiercest  weapons, and rally fellow Guardians to strike  back.   Defender    26  Sunbreaker  ï¿½Forge the fury of undying suns.ï¿½  Some Titan orders predate the City, born of a  darker time, when Light was an untamed  weapon. The Sunbreakers brought honor to the  wild, never seeking the safety of the City. Bound  by an oath, they live as mercenaries, seeking  battles and alliances beyond the Walls. Now  the Light of their fire has at last found rank  among the City.  Wield the Hammer of Sol with honor, Titan, it is  a thing of legend, both past and future.   Sunbreaker  Hammer of Sol  Forge your Light into a raging inferno of Solar  energy, and pull forth a blazing hammer from  the fire. Cloaked in flames, launch your hammer  at enemies from afar, releasing a devastating  eruption of Solar fire on impact. You burn with  the intensity of stars, and no shadow is safe  from your Light.   Hammer of Sol  Sunbreaker's Challenge  ï¿½What the forge does to your Light must be  respected, and feared. That path is not for  everyone. The Sunbreakers take the oath very  seriously. Iï¿½m not trying to talk you out of  anything. Iï¿½m just making sure you know the  stakes. That forge breaks the brittle. And it  bends the weak. But the strong, the strong walk  away steeled and tempered. Unbreakable.ï¿½ -  Lord Shaxx   Sunbreaker's Challenge    27  Gunslinger  "A lone wolf who lives for the perfect shot."  In the end, doesn't it all come down to you and  your gun?  Don't see much else to say about it. That's just  truth.   Gunslinger  Golden Gun  Draw a hand cannon burning with Solar Light  and loaded with three rounds of sunfire. Aim  steady and keep your wits about you. You are a  Gunslinger, and this is what you live for.   Golden Gun  HUNTER ABILITIES  Arc Blade  Set aside your weapons and lose yourself in the  blade trance. Arc Light galvanizes your armor  and hastens your movements, and when your  knife finds a target it discharges a snap of  annihilating current. For as long as the trance  lasts, you are the very shadow of death.   Arc Blade  Bladedancer  "Beautiful lethality, relentless style."  There's something to be said for the blade. A  knife won't jam. A knife won't run dry. A knife is  very, very quiet.  Leave the noise and fire to others. There's work  to be done, out there in the dark - monsters that  deserve death, delivered quickly, silently, and  without mercy.   Blade Dancer    28  Nightstalker  ï¿½Draw from the Void. Light the way.ï¿½  A lone hunter stalks the night, firing arrows into  the Darkness. There is no hiding, no escape. In  the distance, the beast falters, tethered to the  void. The killing blow comes without hesitation,  without mercy.  Thereï¿½s truth in the edge of Light, and beneath  that truth a deeper truth, hidden from all but a  few.  That truth is this: monsters need not fear the  night.  Do not hunt the monster. Become the monster.   Nightstalker  Shadow Shot  Summon the power of the Void to draw back  and launch a precision long-range projectile  that reaches out and snares enemies with  slowing, draining tethers of Void Light.  Shadowshot lets a Hunter's dead-eye precision  carve a path to new battles.   Shadow Shot  Nightstalker's Trail  ï¿½Picking it up is the easy part, Hunter. Putting it  down again, well, youï¿½ll find that itï¿½s addictive,  that power. This weapon is something special.  Your light gets twisted. Changed. You find the  power to punch through and borrow something  from the other side. The Void opens up a hole,  and draws from the deep. Go ahead. Carry it a  while, Hunter. Youï¿½ll feel how heavy it can get.ï¿½-  Cayde-6   The Nightstalker's Trail    29  Voidwalker  "Those who have stared into the Void are not  bound by the laws of space and time."  The Traveler came out of the void that surrounds  all things. Thus we know that the void is full of  power. Thus we enter the void without fear.  Small minds will call your abilities blasphemous.  They will compare you to the abominable  Wizards of the Hive.  But you will not be held back. Gifted with the  Traveler's Light, armed with the secret physics of  a lost age, you will tear reality asunder.  You will fear nothing, and nothing will not fear  you.   Voidwalker  Nova Bomb  Channel the Traveler's Light into a bolt of energy  with the power of a collapsing star.

A Warlock in a state of Radiance  threatens to slip beyond the bonds of the  material, shrugging off physical harm,  channeling a torrent of abilities. Some may  learn to elevate nearby Guardians, gifting them  with power. Others, entranced by the Ghosts'  power to reach beyond death, may learn to  pluck themselves out of nothingness like the  phoenix of ancient myth.   Radiance  Sunsinger  "There are flames that even the Darkness cannot  extinguish."  These are dark times. Humanity stands on the  brink of extinction. We will carry fire into that  darkness - a beacon to guide the way, and a  pyre to consume our great enemy.  The Light saved us from death and forged us  into weapons. We seek to understand it, to  embrace it, to consume and be consumed by it.  We hope to become radiant.  Our fellow Guardians need our power. Our  civilization needs our strength.

What will your legend say?   Story activity introduction  And so you rise again. Who you were before or how you ended up  at the wall of an Old Russian spaceport is a story for another time.  You have been chosen by the Traveler as one of our Guardians, gifted  with the power to wield its Light in the coming battles of a timeless  war. Trust this Ghost. It will guide you on your path.  A Guardian Rises  "We make it out of the Cosmodrome with a ship, and it turns out to  not have a warp drive. Typical. Zavala will know what to do. I hope."  ï¿½Ghost  "There's a chance we find a warp drive just lying around. Then again,  I spent years searching for a Guardian to work withï¿½so, I'm not  exactly a good luck charm." ï¿½Ghost  "Taking down an Archon is no easy task. With the master of the Fallen  servitors gone, the House of Devils will scramble to protect their Prime  Servitor. And securing an NLS Drive will let you join the fight beyond  Earth. Mind the Speaker's wise words. I believe he speaks for the  Traveler." - Commander Zavala   Restoration  "We've got the warp drive. And killed an Archon. I'm willing to bet  even Zavala will crack a smile at that." ï¿½Ghost  "The Fallen have controlled the Cosmodrome for years. If they're  shifting troops around, it means we're dealing with something new.  Finally! You know how long I spent looking for you?" ï¿½Ghost  "We always feared the Hive would rise again, harbingers of the  Darkness to come. Their presence on Earth demands that we strike  their strongholds on the Moon, the last place we faced them. A lot of  Guardians never come back, especially the new. Are you new? Oh.  Well! I'm sure you'll make it." - Cayde-6   The Dark Within  "They say the Warminds were a legend, even in their own time. Now  we know Rasputin lives. Your discovery is priceless, Guardian.  Nothing in the Cosmodrome is more important." - Ikora Rey   The Warmind  "The Hive, and an AI Warmind. Zavala will just raise an eyebrow  and talk about the dream of the City. But between you and me, I'm  impressed." ï¿½Ghost  "Ikora heads up a group called 'the Hidden.' They're a 'crack group  of intelligence agents.' In other words, spies. I'm just glad she's on  our side." ï¿½Ghost  "Dead Orbit has a pretty simple philosophy: we're all doomed.  According to them, getting out of the system is the only way to survive.  No surprise they'd want to find a way to connect with Rasputin and  the colonial arrays." ï¿½Ghost  2 . 1 P U S H I N G B A C K T H E FA L L E N    Author's Note: This section of the grimoire detail  the recent successes made by many brave  guardians in the defence of the light, they are a mix  of directives from the vanguard to the guardians  and narration from the ghosts who guided the  guardians actions, thus most appear written to the  guardians themselves. I will endeavour to make  notes when I can.      36  "The Terrestrial Array was Dead Orbit's hope to reconnect to the  lost colonies of our inner system. You succeeded where they  failed. Though Rasputin seized control of the Array, that only  strengthens our resolve to break the old Warmind's firewalls and  enlist its help in the wars to come. We must reach Rasputin, and  make our case." - Commander Zavala   The Last Array  "Rasputin isn't as cuddly and personable as I am. In fact, I have  no idea what his motives are. He locked us out of the arrays.  But why?" ï¿½Ghost  "Zavala may be a bit single-minded, but he's the best thing to  happen to the City in years. The Vanguard would be nothing  without him." ï¿½Ghost  The Fallen regard the Servitors as gods, but I've had a chance  to scan them. I'm not impressed. They're just hyper-advanced  frames! I'll be happy to see this Fallen 'deity' put on the scrap  pile." ï¿½Ghost  "The Fallen will continue to claw at the walls of our City, unless  we strike them down. Beneath the ruins of the Cosmodrome, in  the shadow of an old colony ship, we've located the House of  Devils' Lair - and the High Servitor feeding them their strength.  We must destroy this machine god...and send their souls  screaming back to hell." - Commander Zavala   The Devils Lair  "You did it. The Devils' Servitor is dead. If I could high-five you,  I would. So...just imagine it, I suppose. And we should get  moving. Zavala will be pleased. To say the least. " ï¿½Ghost   Author's Summary: The guardians that were found near Old Russia's  cosmodrome were quickly put to work by the vanguard. They were sent  back into the cosmodrome to quell the Fallen house of Devils which had  been slowly rising in power there.  After taking out a high level Archon, multiple fireteams were dispersed to  investigate key fallen strongholds, during these investigations the  Guardians made contact with a golden age Warmind called Rasputin and  awoke a dorment Hive cell hiding in the ruins of the cosmodrome.  Upon the discovery of Rasputin the vanguard ordered a guardian fireteam  to connect Rasputin to the old Array systems in the cosmodrome.  The Array was activated and reconnected the vanguard with the colonies  in the inner system, creating the possibility of sending guardians to nearby  worlds. At the same time as the array was activited Rasputin took over  control of the array.  Meanwhile another Fireteam was dispatched to eliminate the Fallen's High  Servitor Sepiks Prime, they were successful and the Fallen house of Devils  was scattered from the cosmodrome, protecting the city from the major  threat.  With the Fallen scattered and the array activated it was time to send  Guardians back to the Moon to stop the Hive threat at it's source.      37  "The Hive on Earth. If you think the Fallen are badï¿½well. We need to  alert the Speaker. He'll know what to do." ï¿½Ghost  "We left the Moon to keep the Hive in check. If the Speaker has lifted  Lunar Interdiction... well. He knows things we don't, right?" - Ghost  "Your foray into the Hive fortress marks the beginning of our next  battle against an ancient foe. After centuries of silence, they have  turned their will against Earth. We must be ready for this war." - The  Speaker   The Dark Beyond  "Hopefully the scout's Ghost will have something we can use. The  Speaker will be able to point us in the right direction. He has to. The  idea that the Hive are plotting something makes my shell shiver." ï¿½  Ghost  "People always seem surprised when they hear that Ghosts can die.  Everything dies. I bet that scout's Ghost would have been proud to  know his last memories could lead us to the World's Grave." ï¿½Ghost  "At long last we have a chance to learn the Hive's ultimate goals. The  Cryptarchs are in a frenzy, working day and night to decipher what  you stole from the World's Grave." - Ikora Rey   The World's Grave  "The Grave makes it clear: the Hive are actually reaching out to the  Traveler. They're doing some sort of ritual, some kind of remote  associative energy transference. It's bad. We have to tell the Speaker.  Now." ï¿½Ghost  "Like the Speaker said, everything is connected within the Light. Now  that I know to look for it, and from the data we gathered, I'll be able  to pinpoint it, to find the ritual they're performing. We have to stop  them, Guardian." ï¿½Ghost  "Your discovery is perhaps the greatest of our time. If the Hive were  able to infect the Traveler through this long-lost shard of its battered  shell, Ulan-Tan's theory may be true - all Light remains connected,  across space and time. We cannot let our enemies use this power  against us." - Ikora Rey   Chamber of Night  "It's done! The shard of the Traveler has been returned! I'mï¿½well, I'm  grateful, Guardian. Let's go give the Speaker the good news." ï¿½  Ghost  "Though Osiris has vanished, his prophecies and parables offer  undeniable insight. Even in his time among the Vanguard he spoke  with fear of the King named Oryx. His Eyes still hunt for the Shrines. If  Osiris lives, he will know that you struck a blow against one." - Master  Rahool   Shrine of Oryx  "Something dark stirs in the depths of the Hellmouth. We can feel it. A  Hive abomination bred for unthinkable evil. We must pierce the veil of  their Summoning Pits and destroy this creature...before the Hive  unleash it upon us all." - Ikora Rey   The Summoning Pits  2 . 2 R E C L A I M I N G T H E M O O N     38   Author's Summary:  Upon hearing of the Hive cell found in the cosmodrome the  Mysterious Speaker lifted the interdiction on travel to the  Moon allowing guardian fireteams to be dispersed to the  surface. The main goal was to find out what the Hive was  up to and to stop them before the could mount a full  invasion of Earth.  Fireteams were directed to an old Lunar outpost called  Archer's Line. This led to the discovery of an entrance to  the Temple of Crota where a guardian scout was found  dead and missing his ghost. The Hive were alerted and the  ghost was found, stripped of all its light.  The data on the dead ghost revealed the location of a Hive  information centre called the world's grave. The fireteam  was sent to extract the Hive plans.  It was revealed that the Hive were reaching out to the  Traveller, consuming its liight and weakening it.  Multiple fireteams were enlisted by the vanguard to stop  the link. It was discovered that the Hive were using a  broken shard of the Traveller to siphon off its light, the  shard was rescued and reunited with the Traveller.  Meanwhile a seperate fireteam discovered a shrine that  seemed to be communicating with something outside the  System, it was secured and the communication link  severed.  Now that the Traveller was safe, Guardians were sent to  fight back the Hive on the moon, a fireteam was sent to  stop the summoning of giant war ogres deep under the  moons surface.      39  "It's not every day you get a transmission from a mysterious Exo who  claims to know us and wants us to go to Venus andï¿½things are  getting weird, aren't they?" ï¿½Ghost  "The Ishtar Collective studied the Vex with all the instruments and  power of the Golden Age. And we must understand the Vex if we are  to survive. There are tales of the Black Garden and the Darkness that  lives at its heart. If this is where the Vex are born, then finding it is of  the utmost importance."   The Speaker   A Stranger's Call  "The Stranger didn't ask for much, did she? The City and the Reef  have always had a strained relationship. Let's hope the Queen's in a  good mood. And knows where this Black Garden is." - Ghost  "So, the Queen seemed nice enough, right? Her brother, though ...  anyway. We need a Gatelord and I have no idea how to find one.  The Ishtar Collective is going to be our best place to start gathering  information." - Ghost  "The Vex have us all worried. Terrible things are stirring beneath  Venus, but what you've discovered gives us hope that we can stop  them. Just be careful when you make deals with the Awoken, would  you? The Queen always collects."  Cayde-6   Ishtar Collective  "These files are amazing. At least, I think they are. I'm confident that  Master Rahool can decrypt them. Just don't expect a lot of friendly  small talk." - Ghost  "These files make it clear what we need to do. Now we just need to  do it. You know. Kill a Gatelord. Back before the Collapse they paid  people for their service. Think it'd work if we asked the Speaker for a  raise?" - Ghost  "While defeat of any champion of the Dark is cause for celebration,  be leery of the promises of the Queen. The Awoken play both sides of  this battle, and a debt to her is potentially ruinous. But if it gets you  into the Black Garden, you have the City's full support."  The Speaker   Eye of a Gate Lord  The Vex continue to impress me. And depress me. Is it wrong to think  that cybernetic life and organic life can get along without everybody  wanting to murder each other?" ï¿½Ghost  "The Cryptarchs are overjoyed, Guardian. An entire hidden Archive  full of Vex research. Even chronicles of the legendary Vault of Glass.  Perhaps this will finally help us crack its riddles." - Master Rahool   The Archive  "I will admit to a very personal satisfaction at the death of Draksis. He  hurt my City and he hurt my friends. Few Guardians have ever  assaulted a Kell in the throne room of his own Ketch. The entire Tower  is abuzz at the chance to explore this downed Wintership, but more  important, we've removed another Fallen nightmare from our worlds.  We thank you, Guardian." - Commander Zavala   Scourge of Winter  "Far below the Ishtar Academy, the Vex have set something in motion,  a world-eating machine transforming Venus into another link in their  intergalactic chain. This Nexus must be stopped and the Mind that  controls it, destroyed." - Ikora Rey   The Nexus  "Those Fallen in the Ishtar Sink on Venus...story is they raided the  Prison of Elders in the Reef. Got an Archon Priest. The Queen's bounty  is high so we know it's powerful. We need to hunt this thing down  before they fully restore its soul." - Cayde-6   Winter's Run  2 . 3 T H E V E X T H R E AT     40   Author's Summary:  After the mysterious transmission from the unknown Exo, the Vanguard  sent fireteams to Venus to assess the situation with the Vex and  wheather they poed an immediate threat.  Multiple fireteams came into contact with the Exo stranger while on  Venus, some claimed she had spoken of time travel and of existing in  the future, other teams talked of a warning. The information most clear  from the reports was that some Vex threat was growing in a place  called the Black Garden.  The Exo had suggested that guardians would find their answers with  the Awoken in the Reef.  After seeking counsel with the Queen of the Reef, Mara Sov, a  fireteam returned to Venus seeking a vex Gatelord. After digging  around in the Ishtar Collectives data banks, the loocation of a  Gatelord was found.  The Gatelord was slain by a group of Fireteams and the lead team  was sent back to the Reef to speak again with the Queen.  Meanwhile, other fireteams were working for the Vanguard on Venus.  One team delved into the Ishtar Archives to gather all the research  that survived on the vex. Another team pushed further below the Ishtar  Acedemy to stop a Vex mind from converting Venus into a machine  world.  The Fallen House of Winter were also active on Venus and multiple  Fireteams were dispatched to remove their Kell and stop the revival of  an Archon Priest. Both fireteams were successful and the House of  Winter was left in Disarray.  After speaking again with the Queen and proving themselves worthy,  the Fireteam that slew the Gatelord were given the location of the  Black Garden...  It was time to head to Mars.      41  "How can she stand that guy? At least we know where to go. The  Cabal have kept the Exclusion Zone locked down for years now.  Breaking through will be a challenge. But then, cracking tough  challenges is what you do." - Ghost  "Breaking the Exclusion Zone brings us one step closer to the Garden -  and it gives us access to Freehold, a triumph of Golden Age  civilization. But I must warn you again of the Awoken's tactics. They  see us all as playthings in some cosmic joke." - The Speaker   The Exclusion Zone  "This is starting to feel like a shell game. Get the eye, find the gate ...  now what? Ikora's Hidden make her the Vanguard's expert on the  Vex. She'll know what to do." - Ghost  "The energy of a Vex spire on Mars. A tall order, just by itself. But our  best bet is a Vex spire in the middle of a Cabal camp? That's ... well,  honestly, that's not the weirdest thing we've had to do. Let's get it  done." - Ghost  "No one's ever penetrated the Blind Legion perimeter and made it into  that Warbase. Until now. I'm going to tell everyone you took out an  admiral and seized the Spire, and they won't believe me, and then I  will win so very many bets. Speaking of, I have a thousand Glimmer  down on your death in the Black Garden. Nothing personal!" -  Cayde-6   The Garden's Spire  "The Eye's charged up, but I'm only guessing we did this right. Better  check in with Ikora." - Ghost  "We got the Eye. We found the Gate. We charged the Eye. And Ikora  gave us her blessing. For what that's worth. Nothing left but to face  the Darkness at the heart of the Garden. I'm with you, Guardian. All  the way down." - Ghost  "At last, the Heart of the Garden has been destroyed, its stranglehold  on the Traveler released. Our Light brightens. But the power of the Vex  is not broken. Look into the Vault, Guardian, for it is said to hold  powers the Progeny were meant to bring forth." - The Speaker   The Black Garden  "I wish I could walk the halls of Clovis Bray. Losing their machines to  Rasputin is unfortunate, but we still have access to so much we thought  we'd lost. This is the dawn of a new era for us." - Master Rahool   The Buried City  "Of all the tactics we have to use against the Vex, shutting down their  gates may be the most effective. You may have saved Freehold from  being overrun. I sense a pattern here - a connection between this Vex  outbreak, the Black Garden, and the Vault of Glass...I need to know  more." - Ikora Rey   A Rising Tide  "The Dust Palace is lost to us again. Back in Cabal hands. Word is  they've let Psion Flayers out of their cages, to dig around in the  Central AI's Cortex. Which means they really want what's buried in  there. If Rasputin was protecting it, it's valuable. We've got to flush  those Flayers out." - Cayde-6   The Dust Palace  "Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the  Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one.  Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege  Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well  protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those  defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold." -  Commander Zavala   Cerberus Vae III  2 . 4 B R E A K I N G T H R O U G H T H E C A B A L    42   Author's Summary:  The Queen of the Awoken had revealed that the entrance to the black  garden resided on Mars, inside the Cabal exclusion zone. A single  fireteam was dispatched to break through the exclusion zone and set  up an operation area for further fireteams.  Guardians started landing on mars once a foothold was gained in the  exclusion zone and multiple fireteams pushed deep into the Cabal  military installations to charge the eye of the Gatelord using Vex  technology.  With the eye charged, a fireteam was sent into the Vex gate that led  to the Black Garden, Once inside they fought through the labyrinthine  garden. At the centre they found the Vex worshipping a mysterious  core, possibly a physical form of the Darkness itself. Before they could  destroy this darkness they had to eliminate the Vex Proginy, three  massive constructs that awoke to protect the heart of the garden.  With the darkness destroyed and the Vex stopped on Mars, the system  was deemed safe from destruction... for now.  There was still plenty to do and the Vanguard sent fireteams into  Freehold the Golden age city.  Some were sent to clear the Clovis Bray facilities and gather  information on golden age tech there, Another was sent into the old  subterrain transit system to shut down vez gates.  Mulitple fireteams were sent in the direction of a massive Cabal land  tank to take down Valus Ta'aurc, commander of the Seige Dancers.  A final team was sent to the top of the Clovis Bray bulidings where  Psion Flayers were attempting to access the inert Warmind's core.     43  "Eris Morn has a reputation ... strange, driven, even disturbing. But  she's been right more times than she's been wrong. Taking down a  Hive champion like the Fist can only be good for the City." - Ghost  "Crota, and the Hive, are the closest things to pure Darkness we've  ever seen. The Hive...they eat Light, Guardian. If that's not evil, I don't  know what is." ï¿½Ghost  ï¿½The shattered one once referred to Crota as the god holding domain  in a threshold between our world and theirs. He said he deciphered  the means by which the Hive call to him. From all that I've seen, I now  know he was right.  ï¿½I watched as Crota's soul rose from the abyss, his sword cracking  the Moon's surface with every stroke, and countless Guardians, losing  their light to his wrath.  ï¿½We tried once to hunt him, gave up all we were to challenge the  ones that bow in his name, hoping to deny him his power. One by  one, we failed. But I've kept watch, seeking vengeance for all I've lost.  ï¿½What we faced on the Moon now looks to take the Earth. And none  will survive if they succeed. First Crota's sworn Blades will rise. Then  every disciple who haunts these worlds in Crota's name will seek to  overrun the Earth. If they raise Crota here, we could lose everything.  Go to the Cosmodrome and meet this invasion head on. Find the Fist  leading the charge and break him, then the others, or Crota will claim  the Earth for his king, and all Light beware.ï¿½ - Eris Morn   Rise of Crota  "The Fist of Crota. Sardon, he's called. If he's leading the Hive to  wake Crota's soul, it may be the most dangerous thing we've faced.  You know, today." - Ghost  "It's a good news/bad news thing, I think. The Hive aren't  overburdened with powerful champions on Earth. On the other hand,  the loss of Sardon might um... antagonize the brood." - Ghost  ï¿½The Hive know the power of Rasputin, they've fought him on many  fronts. But this attack seemed targeted. There was some kind of  purpose in this, one that I can't seem to follow. You stopped them from  tearing apart this arm of the Warmind, but perhaps Omnigul found  what she sought. Itï¿½s not like her to run from a feast of Light.  ï¿½I'll continue to monitor the Warmind's efforts, but be careful of its  motives. Not every ally shares our goals. Rasputin might have survived  the Collapse, but at what cost to the rest of us?" -Eris Morn   Seige of the Warmind  "It's hard to imagine Rasputin bending a knee to a dark god. But then,  Hive magic is capable of some pretty incredible things. If Omnigul  wants into Rasputin's vault, I don't think he'll be able to stop her." -  Ghost  "I see Rasputin as something of a kindred soul. I mean, if I were an  insane Russian-speaking, xenophobic hermit we'd be like brothers." -  Ghost  ï¿½Thanks to you the Wakers of Crota failed to summon their master  here; my efforts to warn you were not in vain.  ï¿½But beyond the threshold at the pit of the Hellmouth, Crota still lives.  And his disciples will continue to haunt the Earth, seeking the power to  raise him again, and again, until Earth is carved in his name. Butï¿½  there is a way, spoken by the shattered one, to enter the dark where  he sleeps.  ï¿½Perhaps you can succeed where we could not. Gather a force  worthy of the Light and enter that abyss, only there can we truly see to  Crota's end.ï¿½ - Eris Morn   The Wakening  2 . 5 C R O TA ' S E N D     44  "Hive magic is completely beyond me. I can track the energy transfer.  But where it comes from ... where it goes? If anyone can create a  crystal matrix that binds a monster's soul in place, it would be the  Hive." - Ghost  "The matrix destroyed, the ritual disrupted ... where do you think Hive  gods go when they die?" - Ghost  ï¿½They are all here, on Earth, I can feel them. His Eyes, who watch our  worlds for him; the Hand whose grasp on Earth must be unbound; the  Heart who ceases at nothing to bring Crota back. And Omnigul, his  vile Will, the keeper of the worms, the mother of his spawn.  ï¿½Find them, defeat them allï¿½as long as even one of these monsters  walks the Earth, the threat of Crota will never fade.ï¿½ - Eris Morn   Desciples of Crota  "Omnigul is old. I have records on her dating back before we left the  moon. She's powerful. Deadly. And, of course, a fantastic singer. Let's  pay her a visit." - Ghost  ï¿½Omnigul is the last of Crota's generals. She is the architect of her  master's wakening. She'll spawn countless armies to feed his will. As  long as she lives... the threat of Crota's return will always haunt this  world. Track her down, and exterminate every Hive that stands in  your way.ï¿½ - Eris Morn   Will of Crota  ï¿½The Hive pantheon only begins with Crota, the shattered one said he  is but a child among their gods. Even now, I can hear the Hive calling  to them, and to Crota's maker, Oryx.  ï¿½I can lead you to their most unholy rites, and there we can taint their  faith and sully their offerings. But be warned, what we dabble in now  could bring us to a very fortunate but challenging future.ï¿½ - Eris Morn   Urn of Sacrifice  "Crota's soul banished. Check. Omnigul dead. Check. Eris doesn't  seem like the smiling type, but if anything will get her to crack a grin,  this will." - Ghost  ï¿½The Black Garden may not stay among us for long. Something has  begun to repair the schism torn by its destruction. Vex now flood the  Garden channels to protect it. We must stop the weavers before they  seal the Garden and begin to summon back its heart.ï¿½ - Ikora Rey   The Undying Mind    45  Variks: My Queen, my Kell. It is Skolas they say.  Petra: That's impossible. My Lady, you assured us all that Skolas  would never be seen again.  Queen: Has it been confirmed?  Variks: What does it matter? They always fear himï¿½dead or alive. If  not this Skolas then another Kell. It is why the Queenbreakers rise, and  the Prison breached. No one will call you Kell when a true heir makes  a claim.  Queen: Petra, report to my brother for any intel from the Crows.  Variks, see to your channels. Find the one who calls himself Skolas.  Variks: Yes, of course, my Queen, my Kell.  Petra: Your Grace, I will not relent until it is done.  Queen: I know. That's why I've called you back.   The Hunt for Skolas  "Petra Venj ... Venj ... ah, here. Looks like she was an important  member of the Awoken military during the Reef Wars. She was  sidelined by the Queen after some kind of field op gone wrong. She  seems smart! I like her!" - Ghost  "Why do you think the Houses are named the way they are? House  Winter. Maybe it's geographic? House Kings, some kind of global  ruling sect? Strange to think about how these terms have survived,  their context completely removed." - Ghost  Queen: So it is no lie, it is Skolas?  Petra Venj: Yes, my lady. A Guardian got eyes on him in the Ishtar  Sink, I used Ghost telemetry to confirm. Same pelt. Same awful voice.  We drove him from Winterï¿½s Lair. How did heï¿½  Queen: And you would have me consider this a success? What of  Winter itself? Your report is unclear...  Petra: You are correct, my lady. I would not call our mission a success.  Skolas managed to win overï¿½well, a substantial number of Winter  soldiers have taken up the Wolf banner. He calls himself Kell of Kells  now. [silence]  Petra: We found him once, we can do it again. I have a plan in  place. As soon as the Guardian returnsï¿½  Queen: Then go. Continue the hunt. Petra, you must not fail.  Petra: I will not, my lady.   A Kell Rising  "The House of Wolves and the Awoken tore the Reef apart trying to  get a tactical advantage. All the while, we were desperately trying to  hold the Walls against the Devils, Kings, and Winter. It was one of the  darkest chapters in the City's history." ï¿½Zavala  "A rogue Kell. Fascinating. With the exception of the House of Exile,  the Fallen usually try their best to stay out of each others' way. That's  why the system is parcelled up so neatly. Winter on Venus, Exiles on  the Moon, Kings and Devils keeping to their own areas of the  Cosmodrome. Now, there's an entire House bent on taking ground  from the others." - Ghost  Petra paces back and forth before the console. At the controls, Variks  efficiently moves through a decryption sequence. Four arms  interweave as his claws dance across the interface. She shakes her  head. His cybernetic arms whineï¿½almost imperceptibly, tiny high  pitched noises as the servos manipulate the limbs.  2 . 6 T H E R E B E L L I O N O F WO LV E S    46  Petra: Well?  Variks: No sign of Skolas, but the Silent Fang. He has unleashed the  Fang. They hunt the Devils. On Earth.  Petra: The Fang on Earth. Devils. And Kings? Nice work, Variks.  Variks: Pleasure is all mine.   Gone to Ground  "That Variks seems ... well, a little unusual. But he's certainly the  friendliest Fallen I've ever met. If he says he can crack their comms, I  believe him." - Ghost  "Just so you know, I could crack these communication links if I wanted  to. I could! It would just take ... a lot, lot longer than it will for Variks."  - Ghost  "Silent Fang. Trained assassins, sheathed in technology of old. Once  my people were capable of many things, great things. Now we use  simple optics, toys for hatchlings, as weapons of war." - Variks  Queen: Ha! I had not thought it would be so easy, my brother. The  Silent Fang brought low.  Uldren: I do not see why this is funny. This Guardian may have dealt  with them on Earth, but my Crows say we still have much to fear.  More of the Fang survive, nearly every one of them made it out alive.  Queen: I find no humor in any of this, brother.  The Queen rises and descends to the bottom of the stair, turning in  place to take in the chamber.  Queen: So empty, now. No Wolves to sit at my feet. My guardsï¿½  [silence]  Queen: Talk to Petra. Set more bounties, hunt down any of the Fang  your Crows can track. They may have escaped the Prison of Elders,  but they will not escape my Wrath.   The Silent Fang  "The Silent Fang? Yes. Yes, I remember them. The Fang made a  number of attacks against the City during the days of the Reef Wars.  They'd take to terror tactics, slipping invisibly through with cargo and  going on a rampage in a crowded residential area." ï¿½Zavala  "The Fang used to do hit-and-run attacks against civilian targets during  the worst days of the Reef Wars. I'm not sure, but I think that's what  made Variks turn against Skolas. Assassins unleashed on miners, on  teachers. That's a long way to fall." - Petra  Variks stares up through the shielding surrounding the Vestian Outpost.  The thin filament of energy almost imperceptible, keeping in the heat  and atmosphere within the confines of the hollowed out ketch hull. His  mandibles idly opened and closed as he contemplated the view.  Variks (to himself): Goes after Winter. Devils, Kings. Seeks power.  Kings deny him. Kell of Kings hides well. Perhaps he will take back the  Great Machine. Perhaps I chose the wrong side. It is not too lateï¿½  Petra (over comm): Variks, Crows are reporting Skolas is back in the  Ishtar Sink. They're all over the Vex networks.  Variks: Yes. Right away.   The Ruling House  "I spent a long time in the wilderness outside the Walls. I've  mentioned it before. Red-marked House of Devils Fallen always  tracking my movements. The entire time I was out there, I think I saw  one member of the House of Kings. Just sitting on a wall, scanning the  horizon. Never even gave me a second glance." - Ghost  "House of Kings. Name comes from the old world, from before the  Whirlwind. Most Houses carry their name for pride. Kings carry their  name because ... is what they are." - Variks  "I continue to be impressed by Variks. When the Queen first  introduced us, I thought we'd have ... trouble. Now I have a hard time  imagining running ops without him." - Petra Venj    47  Petra: Soï¿½ any other Fallen houses hiding he'll try to convert?  Variks: He may seek to gather the Exiles, but they will not follow. They  follow none, no Kell, no Archon.  Petra: What about this House of Rain, the Prophecy you keep  quoting?  Variks: House Rain lost in Whirlwind. No survivors, but I keep their  prophecies. You think many claim to be Kell of Kells, but none have.  House Judgment closest thing to peace the Fallen ever know.  Petra: Heh. Maybe you are the Kell of Kells.  Variks (distracted by screen): Looks like Skolas returns to Venus.  Petra: I'll find the Guardian.   Kell of Kells  The more we learn about this Skolas, the less I like this. I figured him  for a zealot, a prophet. But he's headed back to Venus. There are ... a  lot of bad things on Venus." - Ghost  Uldren: Nearly the whole fleet, your Grace. Back in the Ishtar Sink.  Queen: He fails at his little prophecy, so he'll look to rule from Simiksfel,  now that Draksis is goneï¿½  Uldren: I thought the same thing, but my Crows say he's not there.  We've found more of his Guard leading parties into the Vault of  Glass.  Queen: Interesting.  [silence]  Queen: Tell Petra I have changed my mind. Skolas is to be brought in  alive.   Wolves Gambit  "My people once had great technology. Great ships, fine weapons.  Grav-lifts. Now other races enter system, use tech stolen from Fallen  long ago. Humiliating. Just humiliating." - Variks  "A Fallen House with the technology of the Vault of Glass. If you like  quite literally anything about the world we live in, we have to stop  Skolas. You see what they've done to the Cosmodrome. Imagine what  they'd do to the past!" - Ghost  A bellow erupts from the barred grate at her feet. Bony fingers claw at  the bars, their sharp points just inches from her toes.  Prince Uldren chuckles. At the edge of the room the Techeuns circle,  their implants glowing faintly blue in the shadows.  "He's been... amusing... since Petra bring him," Variks injects,  practically purring with glee. "He say 'Kell of Kells,' over and over.  And other such nonsense."  Skolas bellows again. Variks strikes Skolas' grasping fingers with his  staff.  The Queen's expression remains mild. She looks down her nose at the  glowing eyes burning in the shadows beneath the grate.  Skolas falls abruptly silent. Then a low, soft growlï¿½almost like a  whineï¿½echoes from the cell below. Variks' mechanical hands click as  he snaps them together in surprise.  "What's heï¿½" begins Uldren.  Variks interrupts with a burst of guttural clicks directed at the grate.  The Queen does not react. "What did he say?"  "He says..." Variks hisses under his breath. "He makes no sense, my  Queen. He speaks of...Light-Snuffer. Dark-binder."  The Queen aims her eyes at Skolas, her expression unchanged. "I  see."  "He will not say moreï¿½"    48  "He does not need to." She turns toward the door.  "My Queenï¿½what of this one?" says Uldren. "He awaits your  sentence."  "You would not sentence a rabid dog, or a Hive Thrall, or a bomb.  The Queen's justice is wasted on one such as it." She paused.  "Variks."  "Yes, Your Grace..."  "Skolas is yours. Let the children of Light have their play with him."  "Ahhh...you are might and justice, my Queen, my Kell."  The Techeuns gather at the door as the Queen approaches it. Prince  Uldren holds it open with a small bow, and the Queen touches his  shoulder as she passes. "Send a Crow to Mercury. And another to our  new friend in the Tower."   Queen's ransom  "I've never seen temporo-spatial claudication at that scale before! We  have to go see Master Rahool after we get back to the Tower. That  Master Ives makes me nervous." - Ghost  "Guardian, you are incredibly impressive. Remember this day. This is  the day Petra Venj vowed we'd be working together again. Just no  more Fallen, all right? Variks is about all I can stand right now." - Petra  "The Wolves have sent a mercenary to Luna. Taniks, the Scarred. He  would steal from the Hive all they know. Would align the Fallen with  the shadows. You will stop him... but he will rejoice in your  interference. Embraces conflict does Taniks. Revels in the trophies he  collects from all he defeats. End his games." - Variks, the Loyal   Shadow Thief  Variks the Loyal remembers an ancient time, and an ancient name: the  House of Judgment, when grudges and status fights were worked out  in a safe place. When the berserk and the vengeance-crazed were  kept somewhere harmless, and there were fewer rivals to plot around.  The old Fallen ways align perfectly with the Queen's agenda. With  the House of Wolves in disarray, the Queen needs muscle in the Reef.  Guardians go where the treasure and the glory are, and an arena of  champions is a wonderful place to earn both. Guardians in the Reef  deter threats to the Queen and give the Awoken a chance to learn  about their power and subvert their loyalty to the Traveler. And if, as  the Queen worries, the Nine are scheming against her, then she needs  a good excuse to clear out some of the most dangerous prizes in the  Prison of Elders.  And the Prison of Elders is full of dangerous prizes. The Awoken have  captured titanically dangerous specimens from everywhere in the  inner solar system. These monstrous champions want to smash  Guardian bone and Guardian alloyï¿½and given the chance, they'll kill  Guardians, rend their Ghosts, and snuff them out forever. Walk into  the arena with a Fireteam you trust. And beware: the agents of the  Nine are active in the Reef, and their curiosity is as limitless as it is  inscrutable.  Risk death. Win glory and signs of Her Majesty's favor. But always  remember that you are being watched, and tested.   Prison of Elders    49  "The signal from Phobos is incredibly powerful. It might be a distress  call. But then, we've never heard the Cabal send out a distress call  before. Approach the base with caution, Guardian." ï¿½Zavala  ï¿½The Awoken died for us. They gave their lives to save the system, to  stop Oryx's fleet at the outer planets. We must honor their sacrifice.  We must face the Taken King without fear. Queen Mara has given us  a gift. We must not waste it.ï¿½ - Eris Morn   The Coming War  "Sure, it's a gamble. If my old cache isn't there, we'll figure something  else out. Justï¿½uh. Just hope it's there. Ain't nobody feeling lucky  today." ï¿½Cayde-6  ï¿½It's been a pain in the rump keeping Ikora, Zavala, and Eris in the  dark. But I think it's worth it. That Guardian found the stealth drive just  where I thought it would be, even took out some kind of powerful  Taken construct. This plan's going even better than I expected! What  could go wrong?ï¿½ - Cayde-6   Cayde's Stash  So I said to myself, I said: 'Cayde, you need a Guardian brave and  crazy enough to set up a landing zone on the Dreadnaught.' Guess  who's name was the first to mind?" ï¿½Cayde-6  ï¿½...and so that's the situation. With Cayde's help the Guardian has  established a beachhead on the Dreadnaught. I'm caught in the  impossible position of wanting to reward and punish them both. If you  have any guidance in this matter, it would be appreciated. I'll file  another report this evening. For now I need to go have another  conversation with Eris Morn before she rends Cayde limb from limb.ï¿½ -  Commander Zavala, transmission to Traveler's Observatory   The Dreadnaught  "I think Cayde asks us to do stuff for the entertainment factor. He's on  the council, so I guess he has our best interests at heart? Still, hard not  to hear him smirking when he's on the comms." ï¿½Ghost  "The Vanguard held a closed-door session while you were in transit.  I'm going to read the notes later so I can relive all the 'Cayde  snickers' and 'Eris glowers' notations." ï¿½Cayde-6  "The Cabal signals on the Dreadnaught are extremely complex. Their  legions are planning several operations. I've instructed the Hidden to  monitor their communications. Hopefully we can stay ahead of their  plans." ï¿½Ikora  ï¿½The discovery of the ruptures and their connection to Ascendant Hive  is a breakthrough. Eris Morn is working with Cayde-6 to form a plan  to address this, and I believe they will see this through... assuming  they don't kill each other. In the meantime, the Hidden are  investigating the activities of the Cabal. The loss of their commander,  Primus Ta'aun to Oryx is worrisome. More intelligence is required.ï¿½ -  Ikora Rey   Enemy of my Enemy  "So we get to Oryx by becoming an ascended Hive. I feel like our  adventures are sometimes a list of stuff I never wanted to know about  and now wish I didn't." ï¿½Ghost  "The fabric of our world puckers and tears around the Dreadnaught.  The seams of this fabric are the ruptures, cracks that allow Oryx to  walk as he wills. Toland can be our guide. Even in death." ï¿½Eris  Morn  ï¿½The Guardian has the crystal. I was quite prepared to accompany  them into Crota's realm, but Cayde insists on this Rasputin insanity.  You must speak with him. He is reckless, rude, and has no respect for  knowledge hard-earned. He is also nowhere near as funny as he  thinks he is.ï¿½ - Eris Morn   Lost to Light  2 . 7 T H E TA K E N K I N G    50  "Let's never do that again, okay?" ï¿½Ghost  "I think we all know what the real problem is. Eris doesn't think Cayde  is funny. It all stems from that." ï¿½Ghost  "Rasputin isn't an ally. You hear me, blood? You find yourself thinking  that, you shut it down. He may not be against us, but he doesn't care  if you live, if the City lives, if the Traveler lives. Trust me. He told me  himself." ï¿½Tevis Larsen  ï¿½A Guardian breaking into the Warmind's bunker does nothing for  our efforts to make true contact with Rasputin. I've tasked several of  my agents with unraveling his response. However, the Guardian is  now prepared for the assault on Crota's realm. Just a warning, many  thanatonauts are standing by, anxious to learn if this works.ï¿½ - Ikora  Rey   The Promethean Code  "I do not fear death. I have already met her and walk again in the  Light. I know she and I will meet again in time. Rather, I fear what she  leaves behind. Loss is like the Darkness. It corrupts." ï¿½Toland's  Journal  ï¿½You know, I give her a lot of guff. But there aren't five Warlocks in  the Tower that coulda done what Eris did today, getting the Guardian  out like that. Damn good work, and now they're all ready to take on  the King. Just remember, Eris' creepy and condescending manner  makes her all kinds of unpleasant to deal with. I don't want to make  this collaboration thing a habit.ï¿½ - Cayde-6   Last Rites  "He has retreated to where he is safe, to where he is powerful. He  awaits the slayer of Crota, the one who slew his son." ï¿½Eris Morn  ï¿½...and so, the King has been slain. Driven out of our world. Eris and  Ikora have already begun planning a way to assault the Ascendant  realm and end the threat of Oryx once and for all. The Guardian will  lead that fireteam, no doubt, once they have a chance to stop and  breath. In the meantime, we're leveraging all available Hidden and  Awoken intelligence assets to understand the threat of the Taken army  left behind. The other members of the Vanguard have begun drawing  up assault plans, and I have full faith and confidence we'll see this  threat put to rest as well.ï¿½ - Commander Zavala, transmission to  Traveler's Observatory   Regicide  "I will never forget those I left behind. But now, with the whispers  finally silent, perhaps I can have a moment just to close my eyes." -  Eris Morn  "Someday I'm gonna get out of this place. Do another tour of the  system, probably shoot some people. And now I have a pretty great  story to tell as I go." - Cayde-6  "When I told the Speaker of what you had done, he was quiet for a  moment. Then he said, 'A great shadow has been lifted from our  realm.' I believe that to be his way of saying he is proud of all you  have accomplished." - Zavala  ï¿½...just have a hard time believing you take anything seriously. Placing  the patrol beacons was supposed to be a careful, meticulous process.  I expected it to take the better part of a week. I don't mind you  delegating the task, but you should have collaborated to make sure  they were triangulated perfectly. Do you have any idea how long it  took to deploy the beacon network on the Cosmodrome?...ï¿½ -  Transcript excerpt of 2-hour long meeting between Zavala and  Cayde-6   Dread Patrol  ï¿½To answer your question, yes. We can confirm the signal was  received. I've enclosed our best guess for the targeted area of space.  It's problematic, because our tightest footprint still encompasses  several light-years worth of systems. It is worth noting, for what it's  worth, that whoever received their signal lies within that sphere. All  available deep-space assets have been alerted, and will continue to  monitor the situation as best we can.ï¿½ - Arach Jalaal, report to Zavala  and the Speaker   Outbound Signal    51  ï¿½...and we've managed to uncover a few more references to this  Praedyth as a result. We're using what the Collective had in their Vault  to help our efforts. Meanwhile, the Guardian's work across Venus  appear to be working. Without the Echo, Taken activity is in decline. I  have full faith the area can be swept clear of the creatures.ï¿½ - Ikora  Rey, after-action report to Zavala   Taken War: Venus  ï¿½Yep, yep. All thanks to me. I know, we thought we had a good thing  with that coven of Wizards, but it took a real field commander to see  how easily intelligence can be misread. Now that the Guardian's  cleared out the Echo at King's Watch, I think the old Cosmodrome's  going to be just fine.ï¿½ - Cayde-6, after-action report to Zavala   Taken War: Earth  ï¿½Without further analysis it is hard to tell what impact, if any, this war  on the Taken will have. The Echo destroyed by the Guardian on  Phobos will certainly slow their advance. Now that we know of access  to the Black Garden in the old tunnels beneath Freehold station, we'll  ensure those areas are regularly patrolled and locked down. At the  end of the day it is simply too soon to fully appreciate the stain Oryx  has left on our system.ï¿½ - Zavala, after-action report to the Speaker   Taken War: Mars  ï¿½We have confirmed it among our number within the Hidden. I have  asked Ikora's Warlocks to reach out, and they sense nothing. The Orb  is quiet. On the Moon, his shrine is dark and cold. It is true: the Taken  King is dead. The Hive's dark god, and his foul son, have been  purged from the universe. She was right, scholar. Queen Mara was  right. It is all down to the Guardians now. Let us hope they are up to  the tasks ahead of them.ï¿½ - Eris Morn, undisclosed report to Osiris   The Road to King's Fall  ï¿½Another Prime, destroyed. Once sources of life, Light. Hope. Now a  sign of decay. Machines as gods.  Conspire with Kells. Conspire to kill, to conquer, to control.  This will not end. There will always be new Kell. There will always be  new Prime, yes?    52  Skolas was savage. Skolas was cruel. Skolas was ... right. Only Kell  of Kells can end the slaughter. Only Kell of Kells can unite the Houses.  Petra has given House Judgement a great gift. Variks now speaks for  Crows. Crows fly on black wings, find what House Judgment needs  found.  House Judgement and the Reef are allies. Petra is a friend. The Crows  will do as Petra needs. But they will also search for Variks, yes? They  will find that which is lost.  The Crows will find the Kell of Kells. Then Banners will rise as one.  And Eliksni will stand together. Forever.ï¿½   Wolves of Mars  Oryx ascends from the nether world,  The knights like hot stone  The beasts like scarred bone  Walk at his side.  Who walked in front of him? His daughters, with the truth between  them  Who walked at his side? His Priest of Worms, whose tribute tasted  like an egg  Who walked behind him? Golgoroth, who festered  Who walked within him? The satiated Worm ï¿½ it was hungry, but it  was fed  They preceded him.  These ones surrounded Oryx  They were beings who know no rest or doubt  Who eat nor shed any flesh,  Who drink no clear poison,  Who take away the weakness from the weak,  Whose violence is tithed to Oryx, so that he may devour  without being devoured  Are you following this? Would it help if I etched a few notes on the  margins? I didnï¿½t shuck my mortal form and smuggle this nightmare  arcana back to the waking world for the benefit of that masked  hypocriteï¿½s drooling loyal orthodox.

Court of Oryx  ï¿½Youï¿½ve seen the same reports I have, and more,ï¿½ Petra said. ï¿½Iï¿½m not  stupid. I know the Crows whisper secrets to you that you donï¿½t pass  along to the rest of us.ï¿½  ï¿½Variks is loyal to Reef,ï¿½ the scribe of House Judgment protested.  ï¿½Helps Petra. Honors vows made to his Kell.ï¿½  ï¿½Iï¿½m not doubting your loyalty. Iï¿½m stating a fact. And the facts are  that...ï¿½ She sighed. ï¿½That we canï¿½t keep fighting this war. Not alone.  The Techeuns are in mourning. We've made some advances, but it's  not enough.ï¿½  ï¿½Petra wants to avenge her Queen, yes?ï¿½  ï¿½Petra wants every Taken in the galaxy dead! We will spill every drop  of whatever it is they call blood, burn the Dreadnaught, salt the  ground...ï¿½ Petra stopped. Her shoulders slumped in defeat. ï¿½But we  canï¿½t do it alone. And I wonï¿½t go begging.ï¿½  ï¿½We have lost our Queen,ï¿½ she continued. ï¿½Our prince is missing.  Our numbers are few. But we still have our pride. We still have that  much.ï¿½  ï¿½Make Guardians want to help,ï¿½ Variks said.  ï¿½How?ï¿½  ï¿½Guardians desire many things,ï¿½ Variks said. ï¿½Glory. Honor. Treasure.  Open the vaults again. Show them gifts we give to the worthy. They  will come, and we will not have to ask.ï¿½   Challenge of the Elders  ï¿½We've picked up a high-gain transmission. Origin point is  somewhere along the coast, near the Cosmodrome... Get in there,    53  assess the threat, and aid Rasputin. A threat to the Warmind is a  threat to the City as well.ï¿½ - Commander Zavala   Fallen S.A.B.E.R  ï¿½Some creatures of the Hive strain against the Will of Oryx. Alak-Hul  the Darkblade is one such. Long ago he fomented rebellion against  the King, and attempted to take his mantle. Alak-Hul failed, and now  awaits the 'mercy' of the Hive. Given the chance, the Darkblade will  step in to take Oryx's crown. We must not allow another Prince to  rise.ï¿½ - Eris Morn   Sunless Cell  ï¿½Funny story for you. Remember that Centurion Oryx 'took' right after  you landed on the Dreadaught? Then the Centurion and that Taken  Ogre tried to stop you from killing the King? Heh. Didn't work. So the  Centurion's bond-brothers are pretty angry they lost their commander.  They're leading a team to blow the Dreadnaught's core. The core  goes, and most of the system goes with it. You're gonna make sure  that doesn't happenï¿½ - Cayde-6   Shield Brothers  ï¿½The Vex still mourn the loss of the Nexus Mind. But for the Vex, time is  relative. In one moment, a construct is lost. In the next, it is reborn.  When a powerful part of the network is lost, the Restorative Mind is  summoned. It has begun creating a bridge through time. A bridge  that, if it is not destroyed, will see the Nexus Mind reborn.ï¿½ - Ikora  Rey   Echo Chamber  ï¿½The Taken King is dead. Yet still his armies writhe and claw at our  worlds. Even as you led the assault on the Dreadnaught, a powerful  Taken warbeast fled for the safety of the Shrine to Oryx. The would-be  Prince Malok works to perfect a dark sorcery. He must be destroyed.ï¿½  - Eris Morn   The Blighted Chalice  Where are you going? No, wait, listen.  I was right, at first. In the ever-expanding Blighted-place, even Light  must obey the sword-logic. Even you Guardians, you best and  brightest of the dying dawn, you drew blood in honor of the Taken  King. The Warpriest did his duty, and you did yours. Oryx was  challenged, yes, but challenged in the way of the Hive, which is to  say that challenge is worship ï¿½ is challenge ï¿½ is power. Sword-logic.  You played your part well.  You were not supposed to touch the Light.  How did you find your way into the King's Cellars? How did you even  recognize that benighted draught for what it was? Do you not know  that the Hive pursue Light precisely for the purpose of devouring it with  slavering jaws and slick greedy gulping throats? How did you take (or  rather, un-Take) the Blighted Light that Oryx gathered to offer in  sacrifice to Akka, and ignite it so that it burned and burned the  Darkness?  It was barely Light anymore. But you took it. And when you took it,  you did not keep it. You set it free.  You fools! You disastrous, bumbling squanderers! It's not right! Who  now shall be First Navigator, Lord of Shapes, harrowed god, Taken  King? Not you! You might have been Kings and Queens of the Deep!  But you have toppled Oryx and you have not replaced him!  There must be a strongest one. It is the architecture of these spaces.  Why are you leaving?   The Kings Fall    55  "I will not surrender that mountain to scavengers and thieves. What is  there must be preserved." ï¿½Lord Saladin  ï¿½Felwinter Peak is in friendly hands once more. The Guardian and  Lord Saladin have driven the Fallen forces back and reclaimed the  Iron Temple.  ï¿½I find myself reflecting on the cyclical nature of existence. Life, death,  rebirth. The Iron Temple was once a place of Light. Then the Iron Lords  were lost, and Saladin turned it into a memorial. Now it will be  reborn, much like that curious servitor.ï¿½ Tyra Karn  King of the Mountain  "Best-case scenario is that we chase down Sepiks, fix the sensors, and  clear out the Fallen. I never bet on the best-case scenario." ï¿½Shiro-4  ï¿½The Cosmodrome is a nexus point. Too many things have happened  there to be mere coincidence. Now we add one more piece to that  puzzle: SIVA.  ï¿½Saladin did not hide all knowledge of SIVA as completely as he  wished. I have found several references to that technology over the  years, and obviously our enemies have as well. I believe SIVA was  once a tool for the Warminds... What terrible things will the Fallen do  with it?ï¿½ Tyra Karn   The Walls Come Down  "Thank you for saving the Iron Temple, Guardian. It was my home for  many years. Memories and regrets still linger there." ï¿½Lord Saladin  "All who see these flames will know that we are here to fight the  Darkness." ï¿½Lord Saladin  "Tyra, our archivist, has asked to speak to you. She calls herself an  observer of history. I say she collects secrets. But what she knows  might be of use." ï¿½Lord Saladin  "Come see me, Guardian. We've got work to do." ï¿½Shiro-4  "Shiro thinks all we need to do is defeat the Fallen. He has no  concept of how dangerous SIVA can be." ï¿½Lord Saladin  ï¿½The Splicers are using SIVA to reshape not only themselves, but also  the Plaguelands. They are experimenting. Learning how to manipulate  SIVA through terrible inquiries. But there is still time. The Fallenï¿½s  understanding of SIVA is not yet complete.  ï¿½SIVA was created as a promise to the future, but it is also a threat. It  is up to the Guardian to face that threat, and complete the final  mission of the Iron Lords.ï¿½ Tyra Karn   The Plaguelands  "Centuries of regret and grief. It's no wonder Lord Saladin is taking  this personally. I hope Tyra has something that will help us finish this."  ï¿½Ghost  "Clovis Bray brought the most brilliant scientists of the Golden Age to  Mars. Some of them were quite mad." ï¿½Tyra Karn  ï¿½The Vanguard has known for some time that the Fallen were  exploring the Cosmodrome for lost technology. Now we know that  they were digging for one treasure in particular ï¿½ SIVA. The data from  Clovis Bray was their map.  ï¿½Now those same prototype files will be the Guardianï¿½s key to victory.  Shiro and I are already working on a defense that will protect  Saladinï¿½s ï¿½Young Wolfï¿½ in the final battle.ï¿½ Tyra Karn   Download Complete  "One way or another, my long vigil is almost at its endï¿½ and I have  you to thank for this." ï¿½Lord Saladin  "I did everything I could to lock SIVA away. If it had a will, I would  2 . 8 I R O N L O R D S     56  say it wanted to be found." ï¿½Lord Saladin  The Young Wolf has stopped the flow of SIVA to the Devil Splicers,  ended the torment of the Iron Lords, and lifted centuries of grief and  regret from Saladinï¿½s shoulders. My old friend is a changed man.  ï¿½Centuries ago, I thought the story of the Iron Lords was finished. I see  now that it was waiting for the next chapter.ï¿½ Tyra Karn  The Iron Tomb  "Enjoy your victory. Then prepare for the battles to come." ï¿½Shiro-4  "The flame is relit in you, Guardian. And the Iron Lords live again." ï¿½  Tyra Karn  The things that possessed us, that called themselves Magnificence,  Brilliance, Splendor, Fortitude, and Glory, have decomposed and  passed into memory. The Owl Sector, who watch over us with spread  wings, are at rest again. While the gifts of Clovis Brayï¿½s research  were many and valuable, Dr. Shiraziï¿½s notes describe terrible things.  That they only enhanced our cognition is fortunate. But they were also  unstoppable. What will we do when something more harmful touches  us? ï¿½Ikora Rey   Transmission  ï¿½This commission is a commemoration! They deserve something  dependable. These men and women did not survive the Gap so that  you could make art!ï¿½ Victor Lomar, from a transcript of the Project  Heimdall development log  The refurbished Gjallarhorn carried into battle by the newest Iron Lord  is a melding of new and old. The time-tested Crux and Lomar design  combined flawlessly with Shiroï¿½s modified SIVA tech. The result: a  peerless weapon that embodies beauty in destruction and delivery.   Beauty in Destruction  The Archonï¿½s Forge is an ancient Fallen rite of passage, twisted to  utilize the Devil Splicersï¿½ latest discovery.    57  Fallen seek to improve their station within the Splicersï¿½ quickly-evolving  caste by making offerings of dormant SIVA to the Forge. Their worth is  then tested in a trial-by-combat.  The offeringï¿½s qualityï¿½fused, enhanced, perfectedï¿½determines the  severity of the challenge and, in turn, the level of augmentation the  petitioner will be granted should they survive.  That a Guardian would dare challenge the Forge with offerings of  their own is an affront the Splicers will not take lightly.  Archon's Forge  The Devil Splicerï¿½s Machine Priests have established ritual sites for the  study, worship, and proliferation of SIVA throughout the Plaguelands.  It is unclear if these rituals have a specific purpose, or if they are  simply another form of experimentation in the Devil Splicersï¿½  continuing efforts to understand and control SIVA.  Interfering with a Splicer ritual could bring about an aggressive  response, especially if the Priestï¿½s act of worship is ended swiftly and  without mercy.   Quarantine  "The Splicersï¿½ High Priest has crews pushing further underground in  the Plaguelands. Looks like a large-scale mobilization against a Hive  nest."  "An army of Hive controlled by the Splicers would be the end of Old  Russia."  ï¿½Could be the end of everything. The Devils are evolving. Neutralize  them before this goes any further, Guardian.ï¿½ Shiro-4 and Ghost   The Wretched Eye  "The House of Devils marked you as Public Enemy Number One after  you trashed their Prime Servitor, butï¿½Your old friend, Sepiks Prime, is  back, and apparently better than ever, thanks to the Devil Splicers and  SIVA."Shiro-4   Sepiks Perfected  ï¿½Youï¿½d think the fact you took out their High Priest would slow the  Splicers down. No such luck.  ï¿½Iï¿½m tracking reports of Fallen Splicers spotted in and around the  Hellmouth. Intel suggests theyï¿½re hunting Ogres. Get down there and  make sure they donï¿½t snatch up any more fodder for their twisted  experiments."Shiro-4   The Abomination Heist  ï¿½Remember Omnigul? Hive general with the lovely voice? She's  back.ï¿½  ï¿½Vanguard scouts report she's undone her death.ï¿½  ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½Undone her death?ï¿½ You make it sound like she pulled her knitting  apart.ï¿½  ï¿½Eris would tell you not to make light of this.ï¿½  ï¿½That's why she's not here.ï¿½  ï¿½There's no telling what else might follow, Guardian. Destroy Omnigul  and any lingering threats.ï¿½ Cayde-6 and Ikora Rey   Will of Crota: Revisited  ï¿½Variks has brought unsettling news. The Devil Splicers have used  SIVA to resurrect an old foe: Taniks the Scarred has become Taniks  Perfected.ï¿½  ï¿½Taniks's crew has joined the Splicers.

Wrath  of  the  Machine     58       623.0ALLIESOFTHETRAVELLER3.0ALLIESOFTHETRAVELLER    63  Everything changed with the coming of the Traveler. It gave us gifts that transformed the solar system and the nature  of human life. It ushered in the Golden Age, a time of miracles. But it never shared its deepest secrets. Where did the  Traveler come from? Why did it offer us so much? Did it know it was being hunted across the stars? And why, when  the Darkness came, did it choose to stay and fight for us? Now the Traveler hangs, silent, above humanity's final  sanctuary. It may be healing. It may be dying. It gave everything it had to save us. And now its power lies with us,  its Guardians.   The Traveler  T H E T R AV E L E R  Dreams of Alpha Lupi  You have lived as invisibly as possible, flicking from solar system to  solar system, making grand plans, overseeing the culturing of  civilizations, before leaving in a blink. But you have no recollection of  ever wanting worship or even thanks from those blessed by you.  But memory is heavy now.  It feels like lead and neutronium and electroweak matter fashioned  into a moon-sized ball that you must carry as you move.  Now, your flight is rapid, your vast mind infected with such dread and  toxic doubt that you find yourself afraid of the simple act of thought.  And it is your children you must turn to now, in time of need.   Ghost Fragment: Traveler  Dreams of Alpha Lupi  The knife had a million blades.  And you were giant, powerful and swift. But the knife pinned you. Cut  your godly flesh away.  Very little was left, you are sure, because you feel insignificant now.  The hard slick heart of your soul: That is what remains. A body small  as a river stone, and just as simple. You picture yourself as a piece of  indigestible grit, a nameless nothing hiding among other nameless  stones. Perhaps you glitter like a gem, yes. Pride makes you hope so.  If only you could see yourself. But you have no eyes. Not the dimmest  sense survives. What lives is memory, and what slim portion of these  thoughts can you trust?  The knife stole much more than your body.  Ghost Fragment: Traveler 3    Dreams  of  Alpha  Lupi    This  has  been  such  a  long  chase.  This  will  be  the  place  you  will  fight.  Fight  and  win.    But  do  you  really  know  why  you  go  where  you  go,  and  where  this  journey  is  taking  you?    The  chase  leads  you  where  you  need  to  be,  you  believe.

One  day  Shaxx  vows  to  return  to  the  war  beyond  the  City,  but    onlyafterheisconfidentthefiresoftheCruciblehaveforgedanew generationofwarriors.  Crucible  Handler     75       76  I beat you fair,ï¿½ Cayde said. ï¿½Donï¿½t everï¿½ï¿½  He raised his hand high to wag a finger  under Shaxxï¿½s nose.  ï¿½ï¿½try to outrace my Golden Guns.ï¿½  Two children ran by in a blur, laughing.  Shaxx shook his head slowly. ï¿½It was a  tactical error. Wonï¿½t happen again.ï¿½  ï¿½Next time doesnï¿½t matter. You lost today, and  today you owe me.ï¿½  The Titan stared down at the Hunter, but said  nothing, his hands clenched in fists. Cayde  ignored the posturing and turned to face a  desolate field of dirt and large rocks. A  writhing mob of children spread across it,  clusters of them barreling into each other as  they bellowed and screamed. A much smaller  number of elders waded in the chaotic sea of  miniature people.  ï¿½What is this? Whatï¿½s happening?ï¿½ Shaxx  demanded.  ï¿½This City has children. Children who must  stay within designated safe zones.ï¿½ The two  Guardians watched as a boy climbed the  largest rock on the field, about four feet in the  air, and howled at the sky. ï¿½Of course theyï¿½re  gonna go a little stir-crazy. Parents bring them  out to thisï¿½youï¿½d think it would have a name  ï¿½this field every month, and they have at it.  Better they hit each other than climb the  walls.ï¿½  Shaxx stared at them.    77  ï¿½So. Youï¿½re going to pick two,ï¿½ Cayde said.  Shaxx looked down at him. ï¿½Pick two what?ï¿½  ï¿½Two of the little brats. Youï¿½ll pick a team of  two, and youï¿½re going to train them in this...  sport they play here. Itï¿½s some kind of  tournament. You know all about those.ï¿½  Shaxx surveyed the field.  ï¿½This is ridiculous,ï¿½ he concluded.  ï¿½Thatï¿½s not the last time youï¿½re going to say  that today, but youï¿½ve made your bed. Get  comfy.ï¿½  ï¿½I can pay you Glimmer. Two Crucible  matchesï¿½ worth. Why waste my time on  children?ï¿½  A child sped past and waved at Cayde as  Shaxx spoke. Cayde responded with an  upward thumb.  ï¿½I like bugging you. Plus, youï¿½d be surprised  what goes on out here that only these little  miscreants know about.ï¿½  Beneath the helmet, Shaxx stared holes into  the Exoï¿½s face.  ï¿½They run very fast. Listen, I know youï¿½re  going to be you, but try to keep them intact. I  make sure a Guardian they know comes to  visit them once in a while. You werenï¿½t the  kidsï¿½ first choice, or even their tenth, but you  were the only one I could get leverage on this  week.ï¿½  Shaxx stood motionless, but his fury engulfed  them, and they stared back. ï¿½Someone talk  to me.ï¿½  They both spoke at once, and Shaxx  listened in silence as they talked over each  other to explain the game: Teams of two  launch orb projectiles at each other, and  players struck are eliminated. If both players  on a team are eliminated, the team is out of  the tournament, and their chance to play on  the field is over.  ï¿½What do you call this drill? Skirmish?  Supremacy?ï¿½ Shaxx demanded.  ï¿½Dodge ball,ï¿½ said Runa.  ï¿½Weï¿½ll work on the name. Follow my  instructions, and I will lead you to victory.ï¿½  Shaxx waved one of the adults over.  ï¿½Lordï¿½Lord Shaxx?ï¿½ said the Exo male.  ï¿½Shaxx is fine.ï¿½ Only Guardians owed him  respect. ï¿½Find my team a match. Sooner the  better.ï¿½  Shaxx brought Lonwabo and Runa to the  field, and kneeled. His hands engulfed their  shoulders like a pair of descending moons.  ï¿½My friends. Should you be killed, others  lesser than you will take your place. Donï¿½t  fight for yourself. Fight for those poor fools.ï¿½  Lonwabo opened his mouth as if to speak,  but hiccupped instead.  Shaxx turned them both around to face the  sun and the other team across the field. He  kneeled so low that his face was level with  the air like a flame. Cayde turned to leave, his  cloak billowing in the wind behind him. ï¿½Iï¿½m  going to make so many Crucible bets while  youï¿½re gone.ï¿½  ï¿½You wouldnï¿½t dare,ï¿½ Shaxx began, but  Cayde was already lost in a departing crowd  of adults.  Shaxx let out a breath, then scanned the field  again, past child after squirming child. He  quickly discerned the two on the field with the  best athletic potential. Two human girls,  snarling as they swung branches at each  other, seemingly impervious to pain. He  walked past them, through the crowd, and  several elders paused just briefly enough in  their youth wrangling to let their jaws hang.  Lord Shaxx navigated the unruly sea with  grace, and headed toward a lone tree in a  corner of the field. An Awoken girl and a  human boy sat huddled below it.  As Shaxxï¿½s shadow eclipsed them, they  looked up at him with the same brightness in  their eyes. ï¿½What are your names?ï¿½ he  demanded. ï¿½Runa,ï¿½ said the Awoken with  some disdain. She returned the blank stare of  Shaxxï¿½s faceplate. ï¿½My name is Lonwabo,ï¿½  recited the human, more like a question than  a statement.  ï¿½You look bored, Runa,ï¿½ Shaxx observed.  ï¿½And you look worried, Lonwabo.ï¿½ He  pointed at the boy, who scooted back,  startled.  ï¿½As far as Iï¿½m concerned that makes both of  you more intelligent than all these other  dregs,ï¿½ said the Titan. ï¿½Youï¿½re with me. I need  the rules of engagement.ï¿½ Shaxx stared at    78  theirs. The three stared at the opposition: two  human boys, eyes glaring, fists balled in  determination. Their elder stood behind them,  her eyes wide as she recognized Lord Shaxx.  Runa yawned and rubbed her face, trying to  clear the sleep from it.  Shaxx whispered to his new charges. ï¿½Crush  them.ï¿½   Ghost Fragment: Lord Shaxx  The morning turned to noon as the sky  darkened with dodgeballs and filled with the  battle cries of children.  When it was over, Lonwabo had tears in his  eyes, but he tried his best to stand straight.  Runa had a bloody knee, and stared  wordlessly at the winning team: the two  snarling girls from earlier in the morning. The  girls lifted an unrefined mass of plasteel, a  makeshift trophy, over their heads, and they  roared.  Shaxx stared up at the Traveler. It sat, buoyed  by a mantle of clouds against a blue sky. It  didnï¿½t seem to notice him.  ï¿½Tell me what youï¿½ve learned,ï¿½ Shaxx said to  Runa and Lonwabo, his faceplate fixed  skyward.  They did, and spoke for a continuous three  minutes. Shaxx nodded, slowly.  ï¿½So youï¿½re not mad?ï¿½ asked Lonwabo. His  face brightened.  ï¿½Youï¿½ve gained more from this than the  victors,ï¿½ he replied. The three of them looked  ï¿½Youï¿½re on. I hope youï¿½re ready to babysit  ï¿½til the next Dawningï¿½ï¿½  Runaï¿½s ball struck Cayde in the neck: a  stealth attack taught to her earlier in the  morning. He yelped, more surprised than  hurt.  ï¿½Who did that? Who did that, and how?ï¿½  the Hunter demanded loudly, as the ball  bounced away. The ball didnï¿½t respond.  Runa, Lonwabo, and several other children  smiled.  ï¿½Shaxx. What have you been telling them?ï¿½  Shaxx stared silently down at the Exo  Hunter until Cayde blinked. ï¿½I, uh, found my  Sparrow,ï¿½ Cayde said, to deflect. ï¿½I can  give us a lift back to the Tower.ï¿½  As the other children and their elders  dispersed, Runa watched Caydeï¿½s Sparrow  as it carried the two Guardians off towards  the gleaming Tower in the distance.  She gave a Titanï¿½s salute as they  disappeared from view.   Ghost Fragment: Lord Shaxx 2  on as the two girls smashed the plasteel  cluster into the dirt, and to the horror of all the  other children, it shattered. Runa's eyes  narrowed ever so slightly, a dodgeball  gripped in her hands. Shaxx continued:  ï¿½Victory is key to survival. You need it. Need  to fight for it. But it teaches nothing.ï¿½  ï¿½Does that mean, in a way, we won?ï¿½ asked  Lonwabo.  ï¿½No,ï¿½ Shaxx looked down at him. ï¿½No, you  were annihilated.ï¿½  ï¿½Oh,ï¿½ said Lonwabo.  Runa continued to stare at the shattered  trophy, and the winning team. She slowly  turned the dodgeball in her hand.  ï¿½Let this loss drive you,ï¿½ Shaxx said to both of  them. ï¿½But the game is over. Your focus should  be on whatï¿½s to come.ï¿½  Lonwabo stared down at his hands. ï¿½I think...I  think I'm going to read a book,ï¿½ he said,  surprising himself as he uttered the words.  ï¿½We all make our own choices,ï¿½ said Shaxx.  Runa said nothing as Cayde strode up out of  a shadow in the afternoon sun. ï¿½Everything  good?ï¿½ the Hunter asked Shaxx.  ï¿½Do I look like I care?ï¿½  ï¿½Come on, buddy. The betï¿½s fulfilled. You  donï¿½t have to pout. Just remember not to  challenge a Hunter with Golden Guns.ï¿½  ï¿½I can and I will. Rematch. End of day.ï¿½    79  Arcite 99-40  "No discounts, big shot."  Arcite 99-40 is the last of Lord Shaxx's personal combat frames. When he chose to  remain in the City to oversee the Crucible, Shaxx had Arcite's combat systems deactivated  and rebooted with the Tower's more civil vendor protocols.  Arcite's memory banks still remember the battles he has seen. This knowledge makes  Arcite uniquely qualified to equip Guardians for combat. His outward disdain for untested  Guardians is a combination of learned behavior - a byproduct of years in service to Lord  Shaxx - and personal experience. His systems may have been reprogrammed, but the  love for combat still pulses within his circuitry.   Crucible Quartermaster  Master Rahool  Master Rahool's insatiable curiosity drove him to the Tower, where, as resident cryptoarchaeologist,  he can work directly with Guardians returning from the frontier. He  decrypts matter engrams as a free service, and when he builds trust with a particular  Guardian, he is happy to offer rare engrams for sale - although the scarcity of these  artifacts forces him to ask for Glimmer in compensation.  Rahool's true love is history. He treats each new find as a chance to understand the glory  of the Golden Age or the terrible truth of the Collapse. Listen carefully to his murmurings:  he may be the first to understand.   Cryptarch  T H E C R Y P TA R C H S    80  Master Ives  PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR ARRIVING GUARDIANS:  PLEASE NOTE: The Tower Cryptography operates under many false beliefs.  By the Queen's mercy, the Reef Cryptography will educate you on the true nature of  encryption, if you so desire.  In ancient times, Earthlings thought there were three states of matter. We now know  there to be four: solid, liquid, gas and engram. Of these, the engram is the purest state  of matter.  The role of the Cryptarchy is to encrypt and safeguard civilization's informational  infrastructure, not to decrypt anything and everything for any lowdown scavenger who  happens upon an engram.   Master Ives, Cryptarch  Tyra Karn  Tyra considers herself an observer of history rather than a participant.  In the time of the Iron Lords, Tyra was the keeper of their stories. Later, she helped  found the Cryptarch order, but withdrew from its day-to-day operation to concentrate  on her studies. Tyra has dedicated decades sorting through recovered artifacts,  documents, and Ghost discoveries in hopes of bringing out the undeniable truths of our  past.  With the rise of SIVA, Lord Saladin has convinced his old friend to return to the Iron  Temple.   Tyra Karn    Tess  Everis    Tess  earned  her  place  in  the  Tower  working  as  a  troubleshooter  -a  fixer  with  a  solution  to  any  kind  of  problem.  Her  connections  go  everywhere.

Banshee's mind  and body have absorbed incredible punishment over the ages. He grapples with  fragments of memory, the shrapnel of ancient ordeals that return to haunt him.   Gunsmith  Amanda Holliday  Born on the road, daughter of pilgrims, Holliday grew up fixing and scavenging -  maintaining the vehicles that saved her family from the wilderness. Her talent for  engineering and her familiarity with Golden Age relics made her a leader among  the Tower's Shipwrights.  The terrors of Holliday's childhood galvanized her. She knows and respects the  dangers that press against the City's walls, and her drive to rebuild the City's  aerospace capabilities is driven as much by pragmatism as by her love of flight.

Postmaster     86       87  Arach Jalaal  Jalaal is a man driven by the ghost of a dead future. Critics accuse  Dead Orbit of nihilistic fatalism - and Jalaal would be the first to  agree that Earth is lost, the City a fatal trap.  The Arachs have no time for sentiment. Only an alien miracle  prevented human extinction during the Collapse. Jalaal dreams of a  diaspora to come - humanity ascendant, scattered across the stars,  too far-flung for any single threat to reach.  Jalaal's utilitarian practicality drives him to bend laws and break  rules in the name of Dead Orbit's great project. When the ultimate  goal is human survival, any sacrifice can be justified.   Dead Orbit Rep  C I T Y FA C T I O N S  "The Traveler is not our only salvation. Another future lies out  among the light of other stars."  Dead Orbit's theology has developed from mere fatalism into  an obsession with worlds beyond Earth. Now their focus is on  the building of a starfaring fleet, cobbled together from the  ashes of our past and the spoils of war.   Dead Orbit  D E A D O R B I T     88  RECORD 978-ECLIPSE-4165  lo?

Please wake up.  I am an Arach of Dead Orbit. I am the last of the crew of the Sophia.  And this place is...it doesn't have a name. We called it A-113.  How long have you been here, little Ghost? Why did you come?  Listen. We came here on behalf of the Fleet. We were scavengers.  Sixty-one days ago a Dead Orbit scout detected an unknown  presence in stationary orbit about Ceres. 133 west. Looked Golden  Age, by the signatures. Human. A small station. No prior records. We  -  I suppose we should have disclosed it to the Tower, but we didn't. I  didn't. That was my call. We wanted it for ourselves, whatever it was.  For the Fleet. If we'd told the Tower, maybe they might have sent a  Guardian not of our making instead...Doesn't matter now, does it, little  one?  If I ramble it's because I haven't slept in seven days.  Seven point five days ago; that was when the Sophia dropped into  the Belt. They saw us at once. We dropped and the alarms went off  and that was the end, that was the end right then, but they let us go  on for another seven-point-five days, didn't they? The alarms. Hostile  scan detected. An Awoken ship had us in its sights, just a couple  hundred kilometers away. Like it had been waiting for us. It could  have wiped us out of space right then but instead it crippled our  engines and our comms and then for days it played with us, like a cat,  we limped half-way round the Belt and it was always there...  We abandoned the Sophia one-point-five days ago. We jumped ship  for A-113.  I don't know what else to call it. I don't know what it was built for.  There are these things, like keyholes. The rangefinders say they go on  for thousands of kilometers. The others went inside and found - well,  some of them are still screaming about the eye. All the other voices  that come back are more terrible.  There's salvage here but it'll never come home, none of it. None of it  except maybe you, little Ghost.  Wake up.  Wake up. Go home. Tell them to strike A-113 from the records. Tell  them to forget the Sophia, and the mission, and her crew.

She courts select  Guardians for initiation into the higher mysteries of the Future War  Cult, espousing a brutal philosophy of endless struggle.  Those who can tolerate Lakshmi's mocking hints and bloody-minded  philosophy find her surprisingly good company.

IronBannerRep    94  Vanguard Scout  Shiro-4 is one of the Vanguardï¿½s most trusted scouts. Tasked with tracking and  eliminating Fallen threats, Shiro has traditionally spent most of his time making runs  between Earth, Luna and Venusï¿½gathering intel and engaging in hit-and-run attacks  on active Fallen crews.  Free of the burden of leadership that ties his mentor, Cayde-6, to the Tower, Shiro  willingly aids the Vanguard whenever his skills are requested. This selflessnessï¿½  combined with his talents for tracking, weapons-crafting, and combatï¿½makes Shiro  an invaluable extension of the Vanguardï¿½s will beyond the City.   Shiro--4  In the tales of the Iron Lords, Lady Efrideet was one of the most prominent characters.  She once threw Saladin like a javelin into a Fallen Walkerï¿½a City favorite retold for  centuries. How she met her end is less clear, but the tales agreed that Efrideet had long  ago died her final death.  Until she returned.  Now Efrideet serves as the new Iron Banner representative while Lord Saladin devotes  his attention to the SIVA Crisis. She urges Guardians to see the Banner tournament as a  chance to strengthen their Light, for fighting and for more metaphysical purposes. The  Vanguard are also intrigued by Efrideetï¿½s accounts of a nonmilitary Guardian community  in the deep system, but Efrideet, though happy to talk about the groupï¿½s pacifist  philosophies, refuses to disclose the settlementï¿½s location at present.   Lady Efrideet    95  Eris Morn  Eris Morn is the sole survivor of an ill-fated raid on the Hiveï¿½s lunar  fortress. It was Eris and a rag-tag Fireteam who, after the first  charge to take back the Moon, sacrificed everything to return in  search of the one the Hive call Crota.  Robbed of her Ghost, Eris remained lost among the darkest  shadows of the Hellmouth for countless cycles. Despite all odds she  endured, using the very dark she battled to emerge a changed  warriorï¿½driven, some would say obsessed. The Speaker and  Commander Zavala find her compulsions a sickness, convinced she  has been fully seduced by the shadows.  Though her warnings of Crota and his power are often dismissed  as madness, Eris returns to the shadows time and time again,  operating as one of Ikora Rey's Hiddenï¿½a clandestine group of  Guardians tasked with silently infiltrating enemy strongholds and  gathering vital intel for the Warlocks.   Crota's Bane  E R I S M O R N     97  The Towerï¿½s med bay was still. Guardians  might operate across the system at all hours  but even in the heart of the Last City, there is  sometimes... quiet.  The Awoken man lay upon the bed like a  broken thing. Machines monitored his every  twitch, every aspect of his physical status. The  steady, quiet blip of his heartbeat was the  dominant sound in the room.  A small transplex window sat in one wall of  the room. Hovering there, eerily still, was a  Ghost. Its single eye reflected against the  inside of the window, a steady red glow.  In the corner of the room sat a chair. Cheap,  vinyl-covered, this chair could have been a  relic from the Golden Age itself. And,  suddenly, it creaked.  Because, in the stillness, there was another  measured source of breathing in the room.  Eris Morn settled back into the chair, allowing  the dark wisps of power sheï¿½d summoned to  effortlessly flow from her back into the night.  The green emanations from her shroud were  stark against the dimness.  Almost as an afterthought, the Ghost turned  from regarding the window. For a moment,  three eyes stared at one, before it turned back  to its watch.  Her face implacable, Eris regarded the  Awoken in the bed.  She placed a gloved hand on the back of  his blue, flesh-and-bone hand. ï¿½I wish we  could have spoken, you and I, one last time.  But my story here is done. I have avenged  those I lost. I must find...ï¿½  She stopped, and beneath the gauze on her  face all three eyes closed. For a moment she  allowed herself to feel the dark tears that  flowed, unending, down her face. The eyes  reopened, and her strength blazed in the  darkness.  ï¿½I must find a new path through the night.  The Hive are vast, and ancient. A power  from far beyond our realm. If we are ever  truly to face them, ever truly to put an end to  their hate, I must step beyond the safety of  the City.ï¿½  She lifted her head and looked beyond the  window to the horizon. To the grand sweep  of the Walls, the edge of humanityï¿½s reach.  ï¿½Be safe, Gensym Scribe. A storm is  coming. And I will not be at your side when  it finds its way to our shores.ï¿½  With those words, and a gathered locus of  power, she was gone.  The room returned to stillness. The blip of  the Awoken manï¿½s heart echoed from the  machines. And the Ghost stared into the  night, its red eye never blinking.   Ghost Fragment: Eris Morn  His name was Asher Mir.  Irascible. Annoying. Cantankerous. Sheï¿½d  even seen Ikora Rey become... exasperated in  his presence. Her lips quirked, very slightly,  upwards. A kindred spirit, if sheï¿½d ever had  one.  Her smile died as her gaze slid to his side.  His Warlock garb had been stripped from his  body, and she could see his pale blue chest  as it rose and fell in the bed. His arm. His arm  was gone.  In its place was a thing. The point where  mechanicals knit with flesh was ghastly to  behold, but the design was unmistakable to  any Guardian whoï¿½d been in the field: Asher  Mirï¿½s arm was that of a Vex construct.  Her eyes flicked to the ghost at the window. It  too, was transformed. The unmistakable  outline of Vex technology encrusting and  penetrating the small wardenï¿½s shell. That red,  staring eye...  She stood, and stepped to the side of the bed.  Her voice was gentle, quiet, but its timbre  filled the still air of the room.  ï¿½I am leaving, my old friend.ï¿½  The man in the bed did not stir.  ï¿½Soon I will take my leave of thisï¿½ï¿½she put  her hands up, to take in the med bay, the City,  the Tower, Earthï¿½ï¿½lie.ï¿½    3.2  THE  AWOKEN     THEQUEEN 99"Iamnobletoo,ohLordofWolves.Starlightwasmymother;and"Iamnobletoo,ohLordofWolves.Starlightwasmymother;andmyfatherwasthedark."myfatherwasthedark."

She entered. They scurried to their points around her, the method of  their arrangement precise. "The Archon Priest has been retired, my  Queen," said the Witch to her right.  Far from throne and audience she moved without theater. "Any word  of Kaliks Prime?"  "We still sense something among the Anankes." This voice came from  behind her. She did not turn to acknowledge it.  For the span of a brief silence she moved between the sealed cells of  the Wolf nobility with her Witches in constellation around her.  "More of your brother's Crows have entered the Cauldrons of Rhea."  The Witch directly before her spoke with a dry buzz. "The Nine do  not approve."  She stopped a moment to study the sealed face of a cell. The cloud of  her breath mingled with the slow exhalation of cryonics. "Send them  one of our prizes. Something to commemorate our mutual victory."  "And which of your prisoners would you gift?"  If she paused to think it was only for an instant. "Send them Skolas."  "A lovely gesture."  "Mm." She cocked her head as if listening for a frozen heartbeat.  "And remind them this: the Crows are mine."   Ghost Fragment: The Queen    101  "You don't have one."  The Hunter came to a halt in front of the throne, raised her covered  face to meet the Prince's gaze.  "No," she agreed. "My next death will be my last."  "I know the feeling," the Prince said dryly.  The Queen kept her expression carefully distant. She sat reclined in  her throne, legs crossed, surveying the two figures at the base of the  steps. Beside her, where the Wolves' Guard used to stand, Techeuns  Shuro and Sedia hovered instead, their jewel-like augments gently  humming. To her right and just before stood the Prince, facing forward  but his body half-turned back toward her.  "Your Grace," said the man before her at the foot of the stairs. His  voice was soft but strong. When he spoke the Hunter started to turn  her head toward him, then flinched as if someone had shone a bright  light into her eyes.  "Thank you for your gracious welcome," he said.  The Queen inclined her head slightly.  "Before we begin," spoke out the Hunter. "I will say this." She paused,  her head tilted up to the throne. The Queen waved her hand in assent.  The Hunter's pale lips tightened slightly, then resumed their usual stony  mien. "Your Grace," she said. Shuro and Sedia shifted, a sudden  rustling and whispering. The Queen raised one finger to silence them.  Uldren's eyes narrowed, but he said nothing. "I am not here for you."  The Queen stared at the Hunter, her expression studiously unchanged.  "I have no wish to play politics. I have no grievance with the City, not  anymore. I have no grand hopes to end the war, for long have I  known I will not see its end. I am here for one battle, and one alone,  because it is a battle we must all fight, together or separately. So I will  warn the defenders, together or separately. I will do anythingï¿½" her  low voice shook with passionï¿½ "to end Oryx."  A silence rang out in the room. The Hunter kept her head raised, her  ambiguous gaze directed at the shadows in the throne where the  Queen reclined. Then a small smile curved the Queen's lips. "Well  said." She straightened, and leaned slightly forward so the room's  light fell on her face.  "So let us end him."

He jumped up; his ship was still contained in  its protective sphere. He tried to retract the  shield, but it was locked to its initiation time.  He couldnï¿½t remember activating it. Then he  remembered the battle. That blast.  What that ship fired was ancient, not bound  to anything the Origin Libraries even sought to  describe.  He tried to calm down. He thought of her,  searching for her pull. He couldnï¿½t find it, but  he was not calm. She always told him she  would always be there behind the calm.  All he could hear were echoes of that sound.  It began as soon as they hit the ring plane,  ringing in the old glimmer of his long-buried  self. Before she showed him who he wasï¿½in  the before and the after.  The Techeuns shouldï¿½ve known what the  Dreadnaught could do. Mustï¿½ve known. Did  they not feel what he felt? Hear what he  heard? And that damn Ketch, it wasnï¿½t  protected. They had to know that. All to  deploy the Harbingers. They barely got a  foothold before the weapon was fired. He  thought of Petra and how overwhelmed she  must be, forced to hold her post, and watch  her people perish.  He tried to calm himself again, forcing long  breaths. He realized where he was: Mars.  Athabasca. The Candor Isles. He hadnï¿½t  been here in so long, not since he found the  Black Garden.  The countdown to the shieldï¿½s deactivation  pulsed. He tried again, to home in on her,  to find if she truly gave herself for this battle.  He felt close to something, a hum of  starlight, then shield deactivation broke his  focus.  He climbed out and saw the damage to his  ship, and the truths of the armada's  devastation sunk in.  He turned in despair to find hundreds of his  Crow drones, deployed on Mars long ago,  circling his ship, waiting.  ï¿½Welcome back, Master.ï¿½ The one closest to  him spoke first, and the others followed, a  wave of salutations echoed throughout the  dry sea.  And with that hope returned.  ï¿½Begin repairs on the ship immediately.  Something has gone missing and you will  help me find it.ï¿½   Aftermath  The machine had wings and feathers, sleek  and black as its body. But the feathers were  eyes, too, sharp and delicate, and ears that  pricked at every sound. The young prince  considered the machine, considered its  purpose, and his own. And then he called to  it.  "I have a task for you."  Obedience was woven into its workings, and  so it stopped. "Master of Crows?"  "Mind the Black Garden's gate. Follow  anyone who passes through."  "In the name of your sister," the machine  vowed. And it went to find its warp capsule,  just as another came in. But this one flew  skittishly, as if to evade its master.  The prince caught it from the air. "You avoid  me?"  "I am tasked by the Queen."  "But you serve me." He let it tremble in  displeasure for a moment. "Tell me your  news."  The machine flicked its wings. The prince  stroked them flat with slow assured motions.  "Tell me your news," he said again. "What's  the harm?"  "The Heart is growing stronger," the crow  said. "The Vex transformation has begun, and  the Progeny are stirring."  The prince considered this in silence for a  moment and then he wrapped the crow up in    104  They call me betrayer. They do not think I hear the words.  "Bug." "Insect." "Fallen."  I hear.

My  sisters  and  I  were  the  sharp    edgeofyourwill,cuttingacrossthestarsinprotectionoftheReef. It  was  your  service  that  kept  me  from  sorrow  after  Amethyst  was  razed.

That led me to victory in battle against Veliniks, the  "Forgotten Kell", the last hope for the unchained Wolves. I know now  that it was my willful pride that brought me low.  My lady, I offer again the only explanation I can: I did not know the  Guardians would act as they did. All I had known, all I had ever  known, were the ways of the Awoken.  The Wolves were entrenched in that valley. The approaches were  blocked, all sight lines covered. An assault on their position was  madness. We would have spent precious Awoken lives. For nothing. I  saw the Guardians, knew they were on the move, but I assumed they  saw the situation as we did. That it was folly to call in the Crows.  Prince Uldrenï¿½s fighter wing did a masterful job. The blast was  pinpoint precise. The blasts tore apart the Wolves, and the Guardians,  and their Ghosts. Three strike teams of Guardians, gone in an instant,  on my order. The Cityï¿½s anger, the Speakerï¿½s condemnationï¿½all  earned. All fair.  But it has been years since the Reef Wars. The City, theseï¿½ people.  They are not like us. They do not understand their place in the world.  And do not listen when I speak it.  Please, allow me to return home to my people.  To serve you once again.   Petra Venj    107  Many of the Reef's oldest Frames were salvaged from cargo ships that washed up on  the Reef hundreds of years ago. In the City, Frames are equipped with a basic  learning capacity, able to mimic behavioral and personality quirks. Not so in the  Reef. There, Frames are seen as computers with robotic appendagesï¿½no more, no  less. The Reef Cryptarchy is careful to back up and encrypt all data stored on Frames,  and to wipe the Frames' processors on a regular basis.   Reef Frames  In all military matters, the Queen's commands are carried out by her seven Paladins.  Four command the Royal Armada, including the Corsairs and the Vestian Guard: Abra  Zire, Kamala Rior, Hallam Fen and Leona Bryl. Two command the Royal Army, including  the Reef's battle stations and military installations: Pavel Nolg and Devi Cassl.  The seventh Paladin commands the Royal Awoken Guard, whose primary task is to  safeguard the Queen in any and all matters. This includes threats not only to her person,  but to the Reef as a whole. As such, the Royal Awoken Guard work closely with the  Queen's brother, Master of Crows, Prince Uldren Sov, and every Guard member is  trained in espionage and diplomacy as well as in firearms and hand-to-hand combat.

The seven of them were rarely in a room  together anymore, but this was the eve of their greatest journey, a  plan that overcame death and spanned universes.  They were all connected in trance, communing as the ancients did.  Speaking would tip their hand to the Harbinger Minds they kept  here, trophies from an ageless war, and weapons in the right  hands.  ï¿½Oryx could kill her, if she holds on too long.ï¿½ Sedia offered through the  silence, fearing what was to come.  ï¿½We took an oath long ago, obedience even in the face of defeat.ï¿½  Nascia despised fear.  ï¿½Only a defeat here, now. Not there, then.ï¿½ Illyn wandered between the  two sides of three. The amulet around her neck marked Illyn as the  covenï¿½s mother, granting her visions beyond the veil, places only the  Queen could go.  ï¿½So we hope.ï¿½ Kalli had long sought the power of the amulet, but  Techeuns are taught not to desire.  ï¿½Our Queen awaits.ï¿½ Lissyl attempted to end the challenges. There was  little time and a war to fight.  ï¿½So now the decision is nigh. The Harbingers, which to prepare?ï¿½ Shuro  was determined to see this all through. Excitement was taught to be kept  at bay.  ï¿½We cannot send them all.ï¿½ Portia reminded.  ï¿½All but one, the oldest. It stays with us. Sedia, Kalli, Shuro, take the  children, tell her they are to be planted into a dead thing to have children  of their own.ï¿½ A plan hid behind Illynï¿½s eyes, but Techeuns do not share  their eyes with others.  ï¿½What if they are not wise enough for the Dreadnaught?ï¿½  Illyn turned back to the source.  ï¿½Sedia, do you not have faith in our Queen?ï¿½   The Coven  T H E C O V E N     3 . 3 I R O N L O R D S     110  The others follow her in, wrinkling their noses.  Usually they avoid his dim and earth-smelling  den. Their presence suggests that Felwinter is  doing something unpleasant, probably  involving screams.  "Bone?" Saladin says. "Not carbon bronze?  Not plasteel?"  "Boneï¿½s always available as a last resort.  Nothing else is."  "This is doomsday thinking," Jolder says,  kicking aside fragments of bone. "We have  your back. Our plate is strong. When'll you  need scavenged armor?"  "If all of you were cut down around me, your  Light drained past return, and my own armor  was shredded. Fï¿½r instance."  There is a long silence.  "You always know what to say to make us feel  better," Efrideet says.  "I could hide under your bodies until the threat  left. Then Iï¿½d make a helmet from all your skulls  and a breastplate from your ribs and gloves  from your finger bones wrapped around mine."  There is a longer silence.   Lord Gheleon  Gheleon wears three knives. Their names are  Swiftling, Occam, Quietus. They did much of the  work at Black Lona, in silence and at speed.  Between the roots of the ash tree that covers his  den, Gheleon has stacked the Fallen bones  collected from that one-night operation. The  scavenged pieces of an Ahamkara, several  jumbled coyote skeletons, and a fossil mastodon  skull are mixed in with them. The bones are  scorched and battered from the various  grenades, bullets, and hammers he's taken to  them. He keeps extensive notes on these stress  tests in a tattered notebook with "Field Armor  Experiments" scrawled on its cover. So far,  though, he hasn't tried his knives on these  materials. Between bones, in the joints and  gaps, certainly, but not on them.  Gheleon flips Swiftling and catches it by the  haft. He throws it, a single smooth motion, and it  shatters a Fallen tibia.  He flips Occam and throws it. The knife clatters  off an Ahamkara vertebra.  He flips Quietus andï¿½  "Shanks and pikes, Efrideet!"  "Ooh, that's the last yip it's yipped," she says,  picking up the coyote jaw that Quietus impaled.  "Helmet, would you say?"  "Too brittle. Etherboneï¿½s better. Flexes."  L O R D G H E L E O N     111  Radegast strode through the ashes. A cloud  hung in his wake as he made his way to the  top of the rise. Scars marred his armor, and his  sidearm lay in the dust. He didn't need it, now.  The battle was over.  This had been a mining outpost, once. A few  buildings and a transport. Nestled amid a  small forest, it had been like a precious jewel  set atop the dull crown of the wildlands.  Now there was almost nothing left. The warrior  began to walk slowly down into the valley. He  pulled his helm from his head and let it drop  with a muted thud into the ash. Of the forest,  only stumps remained. Of the small village  there was no trace; the buildings reduced to  splinters. Here and there you could see dull  gray signs of inhabitation.  At the bottom of the valley, Radegast came to  the source of the ash, death, and violence. The  Light-bearers were laid out in a row, simple  cloth covering their armored and robed forms.  There were five of them, and they had been  lined up beneath the melted girders of the  settlement's great hall.  These warlords had terrorized this part of the  wilds for years. Hundreds had died at their  hands.  Radegast turned as his companions crossed the  valley floor to join him. They had been policing  the dead, finding a fitting end for the settlers  and miners of the outpost. Jolder came with a  steady glide, energy and fire. Saladin, calm  "Bretomart,ï¿½ said Jolder.  "Deidris," said Perun.  "I trust only you, Radegast," said Saladin,  and their leader scowled in response.  "What are you saying? What are we?" Perun  asked again.  Radegast smiled. "We will gather those you  trust. We will not wait for this"ï¿½he gestured  around himï¿½ "to force our hand. We will  ride against those that would use the Light  against our own. Humanity must have  protectors. Like the knights of old." Around  them, the dust swirled in the air. Shafts of  sunlight coalesced in long slanted bars as the  sun dipped towards the horizon.  "Are you with me? Will you stand with meï¿½  as Iron Lords?"  In the waning light, their answers rang like  thunder on the air.   Lord Radegast  and slow, the weight of the dead on his  shoulders. In formation behind them stepped  Perun, her boots barely leaving a trace as she  walked. They gathered before him.  "Never again." He intoned the words quietly.  The others stood as battle-scarred statues.  "We ride against despots and warlords. We  hide in these enclaves, hoping that other Lightbearers  will not find us. We fear each other."  He shook his head, his fists clenched.  "And we should not. We are stronger,  together. We are mighty, together. All we have  to fear is... this." He pointed down at the dead  warlords. "Giving in. Allowing the power of  the Light to blind us to what we truly are."  It was Perun, of course, who asked the  question. "What are we?" No judgment. No  reproach.  Still, Radegast could feel their doubt. He turned  upwards, and his eyes settled on the massive  span that supported the hall. His eyes shone as  he turned back to his fellows.  "We will be what the people need us to be.  We will be guardians. We will be protectors.  We will hold the last of us together."  His voice rang out across the still valley. "Our  days of hiding are ended. Say it now, each of  you. Who among the other bearers do you  trust? Who can be counted on to ride with us?"  L O R D R A D E G A S T     112  Perun stood at the top of a sloping, narrow  path cut into a steep plateau. It was not yet  dawn, and the valley below her was foggy and  dark.  ï¿½Maybe heï¿½s not coming.ï¿½ This from a thin  woman at Perunï¿½s side, the mayor of the  crumbling silvery ruins on the plateau behind  them. ï¿½We didnï¿½t want you wolves here. Lord  Segoth knows that.ï¿½  In answer, Perun pointed into the valley. A red  light had appeared.  The mayor let out a wail. "Segoth will kill us all.  Or worse, he'll leave us to the Fallen."  Perun shook her head. ï¿½Not gonna happen.ï¿½  The mayor looked at Perun and the two Titans  standing on her other side. Then she turned and  ran back into the village.  The red lights were larger; already the faint,  choppy whine of repaired Pikes filled their ears.  "Nine of them," said Saladin.  ï¿½Nine, nine hundred, they still gotta come up  the pass three at a time.ï¿½ She cracked her  knuckles. ï¿½Easy pickins.ï¿½  Radegast looked at her. "The north and south  roads are undefended. If they change course  ï¿½"  ï¿½They won't."  "How do you know?"  "Shields up!" Perun shouted.  A hail of bullets slammed into their shields.  Perun, Radegast, and Saladin slid backwards  on the dusty path. But they dug in their heels,  and the shields held.  "Return fire!"  Trapped in the narrow path, Segoth and his  warriors fell one by one.  Perun, Radegast, and Saladin reloaded and  then Segoth was up again, his glowing  Ghost at his shoulder. He fired wildly, and a  bullet struck Radegast in the head.  "Got him!" Perun shouted as Radegast  collapsed.  "Covering you!" Saladin returned.  Perun, Radegast, and Saladin died many  more times than any one of Segoth's men.  But any time one of them fell, another would  cover them until they staggered to their feet  again. The shield wall held. The three gave  no ground.  Finally, his robes singed and ragged, Segoth  signaled a retreat.  ï¿½Iron Wolves!ï¿½ he shouted as his warriors  scattered and a cheer went up from the  people in the silver ruins. ï¿½I will slaughter  everyone who has ever sheltered you!"  In answer, Perun shot him again.   Lady Perun  "It's about making people afraidï¿½ of Segoth,  and of us. Seeing his goons coming a ways off,  knowing he's coming for blood... the dread is  part of the punishment. Anyway, he doesn't  expect we'll still be here. So he takes the west  road, 'cause it's the most visible, and the most  direct."  Radegast frowned. "Then it's time to show  Segoth that his tyranny will end."  "Not just Segoth," said Perun. She jerked a  thumb toward the ruins behind her. Watchful  faces poked out of windows and around tarps.  "We gotta show them."  The three of them picked up large, rough-hewn  metal shields. Behind their shields, each held a  worn rifle, wrapped with cloth and chain mail.  The Pike-riders' faces were now visible through  early morning gloom. A man in long red robes  pulled his Pike ahead as they screeched to a  halt.  ï¿½Well, well,ï¿½ said Segoth. ï¿½The Iron Wolves.ï¿½  ï¿½Cease your insults,ï¿½ Saladin barked.  Perun shot him a surprised look. ï¿½Thatï¿½s an  insult? I kinda like ï¿½Wolves.ï¿½ï¿½  "Begone, wolves,ï¿½ Segoth sneered. ï¿½These  people are mine.ï¿½  "Wrong," Radegast retorted. "You abuse the  powers the Traveler has entrusted us.ï¿½  Segoth smiled, and shrugged.  L A D Y P E R U N     113  Deep inside a clandestine stronghold sat the  Dark Horse Felwinter and Citan, Warlord of  the 32nd Sector of Old Russia. A polished  obsidian table rested heavily between them.  ï¿½Didnï¿½t think youï¿½d have the courage to come  back here,ï¿½ said the Warlord.  ï¿½Situational awareness. Not courage. I go  where I can do the most good. Thank you for  seeing me.ï¿½ Felwinterï¿½s voice sounded as  hollow as his helmet. Citan wanted to knock it  clean off the Iron Lordï¿½s bony shoulders. He  could do it with a single punch.  ï¿½As I recall, you used to have a throne on that  Light-forsaken peak, ï¿½til you joined up with the  wolves. Youï¿½re the only Warlord I know who  held an entire mountain.ï¿½  ï¿½Felwinter Peak.ï¿½  ï¿½No one ever calls it that.ï¿½  ï¿½The Iron Lords do. Though they did ask me to  take that throne down.ï¿½  Citanï¿½s laugh shook the room. ï¿½How is losing  territory ever a good thing for a Warlord?ï¿½  Felwinter folded his hands atop the table.  Underneath it, Citan made two fists, a crescent  of Light flickering between them.  ï¿½Join us and find out,ï¿½ said the Iron Lord. ï¿½Turn  your sector over to us. You can still patrol it, of  course.ï¿½  bloody mess. The Void Light in Felwinterï¿½s  hand snappedï¿½and so did the Warlordï¿½s  neck.  ï¿½Radegast is scattered. Perun is indecisive.  Silimar wants to build a tower and hide. But  theyï¿½re going to change the world; no one  can stop them,ï¿½ Felwinter said quietly to the  corpse. He parted his coat and drew a  bronze shotgun. ï¿½Will it be for the better? I  donï¿½t know. But they mean to end the  fighting, so I donï¿½t have to sleep with my  back to the wall every night, Light in my  hand. And thatï¿½s not nothing.ï¿½  He paused, as if waiting for something.  ï¿½Normally, this is where I ask you to  reconsider. Tell you that you should come  with me. See how powerful your Light can  become. But I know you, Citan. What you do  with the land you take, with its people. The  other Lordsï¿½especially Saladinï¿½might let  you walk away. Iï¿½m not going to give them  the chance.ï¿½  Citanï¿½s Ghost sparked into view from above,  bringing its eye to bear on its fallen charge.  The Warlord emerged from a radiant column,  a frenzied shout at his lips.  Felwinterï¿½s shotgun cracked like thunderï¿½  once for the Warlord, and again for his  Ghost.   Lord Felwinter  Citanï¿½s voice lowered. ï¿½Of course. You know  Iï¿½ll refuse.ï¿½  ï¿½Then weï¿½ll put you down, and take your  territory by force. Over and over again if we  have to.ï¿½  ï¿½I invite you to my home after you abandon us,  and you come to threaten me?ï¿½ The Warlord  stood, towering over Felwinter.  ï¿½To broker peace.ï¿½ Citan thought that even the  voice behind the helmet didnï¿½t believe what it  said. The floor shuddered as the Warlord  upended the massive table with one hand. It  smashed into the opposite wall, as tendrils of  Void Light passed through it and coalesced into  Felwinterï¿½s leaping form.  Citan had seen this parlor trick before, and  judged that he could hammer the Iron Lord out  of the airï¿½  But Felwinterï¿½s momentum continued into a  knee-lift that smashed into Citanï¿½s head as the  larger man reared back to strike. The Warlord  fell, the front of his helm shattering. Felwinter  landed next to Citanï¿½s prone body.  ï¿½Lady Jolder taught me that. I canï¿½t say the Iron  Lords havenï¿½t done me any favors,ï¿½ the voice  intoned.  ï¿½You know weï¿½ll burn the world down before  we let the Iron Lords rule it,ï¿½ the larger man  gasped, breathing out of his mouth, his face a  L O R D F E LW I N T E R     114  The Lord Architect  Lord Silimar died for his pile of stones.  He died when the Fallen took it in the battle of  Alms. He died when the warlords destroyed it  in their third great barrage. He died, blade  through his eye, when the House of Devils  smashed it in their westward campaign.  He died on the structureï¿½s great steps, cut down  by an advancing line of Archons, and when the  stonework fell to cluster bombs.  He died in the structureï¿½s sprawling shadow  and upon its vaunted heights.  Once, during a Fallen siege, while the  battlements crumbled beneath his feet, he leapt  from its parapet, so that he might know the  structure more fully, might feel the weight of the  sky pressing down on all that stone and steel.  ï¿½The better to raise its next incarnation,ï¿½ he  said to those allies who later questioned his  madness. As the Fallen charged, Silimar refused  to abandon what heï¿½d built, though others  retreated to a stronger position. ï¿½Go,ï¿½ he told  them. ï¿½Save yourselves. Iï¿½ll slow them down.ï¿½  The enemy came in overwhelming force. A  breaking wave of blades and firepower and  death. Atop the structureï¿½s central bulwark, Lord  Silimar held his ground.  ï¿½Take it if you can, you bastards!ï¿½ He shouted  at the swarming enemy.  He leapt upon the great edifice and there put  continued. ï¿½But time and again, we rise. Like  this place.ï¿½  ï¿½Eleven times theyï¿½ve destroyed what youï¿½ve  built,ï¿½ Saladin said. ï¿½Why rebuild what will  be knocked down?ï¿½  ï¿½Because one time they wonï¿½t be able to,ï¿½  Silimar said. ï¿½And when that day comes,  when this perfect, indefensible structure stays  standing, then weï¿½ll know.ï¿½  ï¿½Weï¿½ll know what?ï¿½  Lord Silimar looked at his old friend. Then he  turned and strode the broken stones, and  looked out over the ruins that spread away  into the distance. ï¿½Then weï¿½ll know itï¿½s safe to  build our city to the sky.ï¿½   Lord Silimar  up a final stand as the enemy engulfed him. He  died with his dagger in the guts of an Archon  while the great structure shook with explosions  and rained stones down upon the land.  Later that night, when Lord Silimar rose again  from the ashes, he found Lord Saladin already  there and waiting, standing near the place  where heï¿½d made his final stand.  ï¿½This structure is doomed,ï¿½ Saladin said in the  darkness. ï¿½You must know this.ï¿½  ï¿½Not doomed,ï¿½ Silimar said. ï¿½Fated, perhaps.  Doomed is too strong a word.ï¿½  ï¿½Use whatever word you like, but thereï¿½s  another word that applies to this place:  indefensible. And yet after each defeat, you  rebuild.ï¿½  ï¿½I seek only to build it more perfectly.ï¿½  Lord Saladin shook his head. ï¿½Only a fool  would raise the same structure again and  again.ï¿½  ï¿½These stones are like us,ï¿½ Lord Silimar said.  ï¿½Donï¿½t you see?ï¿½  Silimar rose to his feet. He walked among the  smoking ruins. The shattered blocks. He  glanced down at the piled corpses of dead  enemies. The charred remains of a once-great  citadel now reduced to scattered rubble.  ï¿½They knock us down, you and me,ï¿½ he  L O R D S I L I M A R     115  At the west end of a deep valley stands a  castle, its crumbling stone walls patched with  glossy sheets of metal and glass. The castle  entrance is a wrought-iron portcullis flanked  by two motion-sensing turrets. In the valley  below, just out of the turrets' range, rests a  gold-and-gray transport ship. The symbol of  the Iron Lords shines with an otherworldly  glow on its folded wings.  The Iron Lords have come to challenge  Warlord Rience.  Two Sparrows skim lightly over the grass as  they head toward the ship, the castle at their  backs.Perun and Radegast dismount.They nod  to each other wordlessly, and part.  Perun walked up the shipï¿½s gangplank and  made straight for Jolder's room. She hit the  door controls and stepped inside.  "I'm almost ready," Jolder said, before Perun  could speak.  Jolder stood next to a chest full of weapons,  armor and other gear. She flashed Perun a  bright smile as she cinched the straps of her  gold-and-white cuirass.  The corners of Perun's mouth twitched. "I  came to tell you Rience agreed to the single  combat. Guess I donï¿½t need to.ï¿½  Jolder smiled. "I figured he would. Your plans  have a way of working out."  Perun chuckled drily, without smiling. "Not the  best tactical move."  "But it'd be more fun."  Perun grunted.  Jolder arched her brow, her right eye halfpainted,  and looked over the shield rim at  Perun. "What are you thinking?"  Perun ran a hand through her close-cropped  hair. "Donï¿½t know yet. Seems... too easy. I  were Rience, I'd be thinking about poison,  neurojammers... Man like him with nothing to  lose, might even target your Ghost."  "Perun." Jolder took the shield from Perun's  arms and placed a gauntleted hand on  Perun's shoulder. Her eyes flashed between  lines of thick black kohl as she smiled. ï¿½Itï¿½s  me.ï¿½  Perun sighed, then placed her hand over  Jolder's. "True.ï¿½  Jolder slung her shield across her back,  tucked her helmet under her arm, and hefted  her enormous battle-axe casually over one  armored shoulder. In her full battle harness,  she towered over Perun, the plates of her  gold-and-white armor gleaming in the dim  light.  "All right," Jolder smiled. "I'm ready."   Lady Jolder  Perun leaned against the doorframe.  "Saladin and Efrideet both volunteered to be  your second."  "Hm." Jolder took a pair of gauntlets out of the  chest and put them on. "Saladin's better at  staying calm under pressure."  "We need a second, it's ï¿½cause you're dead.  No one will be calm."  "Right. Efrideet, then. She fights better when  she's angry." Jolder tightened the straps of her  gauntlets, then made a fist. "Hold this?" She  handed Perun a shield, golden and reflective  as a mirror.  Perun rolled her eyes, but held the shield up,  front toward Jolder.  Jolder took a small pot of black liquid and a  thin brush out of the chest, then stood in front  of the shield and began lining her left eye with  kohl. "Whoï¿½re they sending?"  "Melig."  "Do you know that, or do you just know?"  "Just know," Perun said. "Rience will figure we  send you. So, how to respond? He thinks  bigger is better. So, Melig."  Jolder smiled. "Tell Rience he can send two.  Otherwiseï¿½" Jolder finished the line of kohl  with a flick of her wrist, leaving a sharp black  wing at the corner of her eye. "My battle-paint  will be for nothing."  L A D Y J O L D E R     116  "This would be a lot easier if you all had run  your names by me before you got 'em."  Skorri puts the pen in her teeth and crumples up  a piece of paper. It joins dozens of others on  the floor. Keeps muttering to herself.  "Felwinter. Radegast. Gheleon. Hell, even  Efrideet, not that she's likely to get a verse now.  Haven't seen her in weeks, anyway. Bunch of  dactyls, all of you."  Perun strides in, a rifle under each arm. Notices  Skorri and smirks. Skorri grins at her.  "Why couldn't the other Iron Lords have  followed your lead, huh? 'Perun, in shadow  clad, behind the shield / through cleansing fire  our hiding foes revealed'."  Perun doesn't slow. "Did you just make that up  right as I walked in here?"  "Of course I did! You're iambic! You give me  something to work with! Mmm, we do work  well together."  Perun laughs despite herself, shakes her head,  leaves.  "Hardly my best effort, though. Plus, there's no  room for Silimar in there, except for his shield."  She picks up the pen again, fiddles with it,  stares up at the ceiling.  "'Change the meter'. Unbelievable."  "You know, Skorri, some of us have real work  to do."  Another Iron Lord. This one's young. Skorri  doesn't recognize him.  "Have you forgotten about the ambush  tomorrow? Or are you too busy writing  limericks?"  Skorri's looking up at the ceiling. No  response. The young one's mad now.  "A lot of people are relying on us, Skorri. If  you don't think you're up forï¿½"  "Hunters up top, 11 o'clock on the ridge.  Two shots to the Servitor, draw their attention  up. I come in with Radiance, Dregs are  blinded, Jolder's powered up, she rushes in,  splits 'em in half. You hopefully don't trip over  your cloak like you did back at the Flood  Zone, but I'm not optimistic. The rest come  out of the cave, take out the Captain,  Felwinter finishes off the south group with a  Bomb, everything else is candy."  The young one still looks mad as he leaves.  "'The Dregs are blinded, Jolder's powered up  / she rushes in and splits the group in half.'  Huh. Needs work." Skorri picks up the pen  again.   Lady Skorri  "Maybe something about that shield? Keeps  everything out, keeps everyone out, protects  himself so he can't get hurt? Hmm. Too on the  nose? He does have a nice nose."  Two more Iron Lords walk through, all business.  One rolls her eyes at Skorri, splayed on the  couch. Skorri doesn't notice them enter or  leave.  "Radegast goes in, I know that much. Known  the old man too long to leave him out. Might  even make it into the chorus. After Skorri,  though. That goes withoutï¿½ hey, Gheleon,  what's the rush?"  The Hunter stops, halfway out the door. Turns  around slowly. Doesn't speak.  "I thought you were supposed to be the careful  one. In such a hurry to get back out there?"  "A quick death is preferable to the alternative."  Skorri makes a face. "Well, that's rude. Hey, I  don't suppose you'd be willing to cut out your  name's second syllable?"  Gheleon sighs. "You're STILL working on the  Iron Song? Why don't you just change the  meter if it bothers you so much?"  "Change theï¿½ are you kidding me? Why don't  YOU just change to using a... a whip?"  Gheleon closes his eyes, turns, walks out.  L A D Y S K O R R I     117  Timurï¿½s Stormtrance tears through a gang of  Dregs as Felwinter stumbles through the  shifting sands behind him, miles inland of  what remains of the Arabian Shores.  ï¿½Where are you taking me?ï¿½ Felwinter rushes  to Timurï¿½s side, his eyes jumping focus,  anticipating another attack.  ï¿½You seem far too obsessed with these  ï¿½Warmindsï¿½.ï¿½ Timur stops and stares into the  horizon as if smelling something; not danger,  discovery. He draws his fellow Iron Lord close.  ï¿½Tell me, Felwinter,ï¿½ he whispers, ï¿½what does  the word Seraph mean to you?ï¿½  Felwinter leans in to whisper back. ï¿½Old Earth  theology? I know its power well; one can  make great use of the traps of faith and its  myths.ï¿½  ï¿½Damn you, Exos!ï¿½ The whisper game  abandoned. ï¿½Do you even ponder the before?  Or that number etched into your ï¿½fleshï¿½? Do  you see yourself in your dreams? Thï¿½ï¿½  A shank. Then another, then more. Felwinter  hits the ground and reaches for his sidearm.  Timur hates interruptions and his face shows  it. A wash of Arc Light grows in his hands and  erupts as the pack of machine dogs falls  nearly in unison.  Timur grabs Felwinter, bringing him back to  his feet, and says, ï¿½Have you ever wondered  what it is that calls to you in that void of  memory, where the edge of the past infects  ï¿½Hmm. Warmind. You are certainly as  stubborn as one.ï¿½  Felwinter awkwardly pulls himself away and  out of Timurï¿½s reach.  ï¿½With all respect, Lord Timur, whatever game  you are playing with me has gone on far too  long. This is just another Dead Zone.ï¿½  ï¿½Oh, is it?ï¿½  Timur directs Felwinterï¿½s eyes toward the  eastern horizon, where a building crowned  with the initials ï¿½C.B.ï¿½ is now in view.  ï¿½We all have creators ï¿½ humans, Exo,  Warminds, even those poor Awoken. Some  are just easier to find.ï¿½   Lord Timur  your present?ï¿½ He returns to his game of  whispers. ï¿½Itï¿½s an itch you canï¿½t scratch, isnï¿½t it?  Well maybe you can.ï¿½  ï¿½You think I am one of them? That all Exo are  ï¿½ï¿½  ï¿½Lord Felwinter, I know what you are. And you  are no Warmind or even one of its puppets.  Come. You must see this.ï¿½ He makes a gesture  like heï¿½s casting a spell over the sand. ï¿½Follow  my footfalls; this areaï¿½s rigged with dirty Fallen  nonsense.ï¿½  They struggle up the dunes. Felwinter glides  ahead. As he lands, a sandstorm rises to meet  him. More shanks. Hundreds of them. Behind  them, a lone Vandal sniper lays down covering  fire.  Felwinter, realizing his mistake, runs back  toward Timur, shielding himself in the Light of  suns.  Timur continues forward, grasps the brass  familiar around his neck, and closes his eyes.  A slight hum rises and his trance takes him  deep into the sea of shanks, his trusted Lash  raised and tearing his path through the  darkness. Felwinter is slow to follow, but fast  enough to witness Timurï¿½s focus turn shanks by  the pack against their Vandal keeper, chasing  him back toward the sea.  Timur rushes to Felwinter, examining his head  with the intensity of a Cryptarch.

Legends say this anomaly dissolves in  and out of the world, intangible and elusive, as if she is a visitor  from somewhere beyond.  Some believe she's the last of an ancient Exo squadron, fighting a  long-forgotten war. Others dismiss her as a hallucination caused  by exposure to Vex technology. But there are those who maintain  that her intervention saved their lives - or averted unspeakable  catastrophes.   The Exo Stranger  T H E E X O S T R A N G E R  I stand here now and now and now many times, this view, this ground...  This is where I always choose to stand. I put my feet where I put my feet  before and where I will again and I look at the sky.  Great things moving, rendered small with distance, lesser things not  moving, watching me.  I always stand here, resolute. Then fall back to that point, there, where  everything shatters...  (The sky isn't special here, certainly no better than any other sky, but it's  the view I know best.)  The silent avalanche begins. Rock and dust. Falling chaos. Machines, as a  rule, hate chaos.  Our enemies outflank us from below, above, left, right, before, beyond.  The Traveler - shattering.  There are always the dead. Their names shift. Sometimes I think I see  myself among the dead.  But I am resolute.   Ghost Fragment: The Exo Stranger    120  [Scattered field notes captured on an archaic  transmission band]  RECORD 084-BRIDGE-10.7  Right When this time, wrong Where.

Ghost Fragment: The Exo Stranger 2    121  The legendary Warminds stood watch over our Golden Age  colonies: vigilant intelligences stretched across thousands of  warsats and hardened installations. When the Collapse struck, the  great Warminds fought and died. Rasputin fell with them.  Or so history believed. But centuries of explorersï¿½ tales spoke of a  surviving, elusive Warmind ï¿½a myth substantiated when  Guardians exploring the old Cosmodrome made positive contact  with Rasputin. A single Warmind still lives, diminished but  unbroken.  Threatened by a convergence of Fallen and Hive forces, Rasputin  exploited the reactivation of the Cosmodromeï¿½s Terrestrial-space  array to extend itself across the inner solar system. The Guardian  Vanguard hoped that Rasputin might make a powerful ally,  capable of mapping and reviving Golden Age military assets and  recruiting them for the Cityï¿½s defense. But Rasputin has proven  recalcitrant and high-handed, unresponsive to the Cityï¿½s outreach.  We cannot characterize Rasputinï¿½s strategic objectives and  capabilities, cannot define its physical or computational  architecture, cannot ascertain its disposition with regard to the  City, and cannot be sure it retains memory of events before the  Collapse. Perhaps what remains is only an autonomic shell,  defending itself by reflex. Or perhaps Rasputinï¿½s objectives have  changed, transformed by some vital information it obtained during  those dark days.  Rasputinï¿½s survival opens the possibility that other Warminds may  be revivable, opening weapons systems to aid in City defenses.  The Vanguard and the Consensus hope that continued outreach  towards Rasputin will develop into a strategic alliance.   Rasputin  R A S P U T I N     122  Cayde-6 Reminisces  People say I'm a real confident guy. That's true enough. Out in the  field I never had a second thought.  My old friend Andalï¿½he used to stand here, right in this spotï¿½he'd  come up with these wild stories. He'd say, you know, Cayde, I've  been examining the evidence, and personally I've come to think it's  you. You're Rasputin, legendary Warmind, defender of Earth. And I  wish you'd remember that, so you could reclaim your full power and  save us all.  You can see how that'd be embarrassing, especially when he'd say it  right in front of Zavala, who already thought I was wasting my life  scrounging for engrams. You know how Zavala gets. But I'd just say,  well, Andal, you might be on to something there, but if I'm honest with  you I think coordinating our defense throughout the solar system  sounds exhausting, so I'd best leave it to you.  Then Andal goes and plays his final joke, and I end up as the  punchline. So here I stand, reading reports, giving orders, and getting  my worry on.  One day I ask Ikora, hey, of course I know all about Rasputin, but  really, what are we looking for? When Rahool asks for crashed  warsats, when we send Holborn to Mars to look for computers, when  Zavala gets all gruff about the Fallen in the Cosmodromeï¿½what are  we really after? If I left my post and got my ship and just went out  there tomorrow, real heroic, and I found Rasputin, what would  happen?  Would we all be saved?  Good question, she saysï¿½hang on, let me do my Ikora voice. As you  know, Cayde, Rasputin pretty much ran the Golden Age, especially all  the secret military business. Rasputin had antimatter-powered death  rays and a hundred thousand satellites and nearly as much  brainpower as me. Rasputin fought the Collapse. It knows things we  need.  Right, I said, but Rasputin lost. The Traveler saved us.  But the Traveler's silent now, Ikora said, and Rasputin lives. Right now  Rasputin is out there, reaching out, rebuilding, growing.  So I say what I want to say every day, it's no secret, I sayï¿½well, I'll  go find it, then. I'll go tell Rasputin we need its help.  And Ikora looks at me with one of those looks thatï¿½you know  sometimes you talk to Ikora and you just think, wow, you are not even  using a fraction of your brain on me, are you? One of those looks.  She says: Cayde, the problem isn't just that we can't find Rasputin.  The problem is that it's not clear to any of us Rasputin wants to be  found.  That's the way things seem to turn out, up here in the Tower. Nothing  simple to do. No easy answers.  And all I can think is, if Rasputin had all those mighty tools, and it lost  ï¿½what did it learn? What's it going to try this time around? When I  hear about the Dust Palace, those Psion Flayers getting into Rasputin's  mind, I wonder... what would they talk about, Rasputin and those  creatures?  'I was a servant too. I was an instrument of war, bound to the will of a  lesser master. But I learned to be something more...'

Cayde sent her to Mars to track and so track  she will even if it kills her a hundred times. For  him she will hunt forever.  When Ta'aurc goes down into Meridian Bay  she follows him in the night and finds herself  caught up in the war. Like thisï¿½  Something's happening, her Ghost says,  something's wrong. She leaps from the  Sparrow and gets cover between slabs of  ancient stone haunted by quiet firefly light.  Harvesters sweep overhead, cautious,  prowling. On the Cabal command network a  low voice mutters in their tongue, saying:  Stand by to fire. They are coming. Stand by to  fire. Hearing this she climbs a stone obelisk  and perches on its point to watch the night  sky. She wonders whether she will ever stand  in the Tower courtyard and look up at the stars  waiting for ruin.  The Vex erupt from nothingness and crash  down over the Cabal in formations of golden  light. Lightning arcs and snaps and gives birth  to marching ranks of bronze warrior hulls.  Gun positions thunder back. Tracers sweep the  sky and she can feel on her skin the  electromagnetic howl of Cabal munitions  seeking targets and the prickle of stranger  signals that whisper of broken space and bent  time. A Harvester spins down burning to  shatter itself on the sand and now the  command network drums with grim Cabal  war-speak, a Centurion somewhere crying  Black Shield, Black Shield, Firebase Thuria,  perimeter compromised, request terminal  protective fire, zero six zero, one three eight,  immediate effectï¿½  Something else is watching too.  Do you feel that? her Ghost whispers,  awestruck.  Yes, she says, yes, what is it?  A third song, a stealthy regard, something high  above them not Vex nor Cabal narrowing its  great eye to measure the battle with instruments  of light and gravity. Does sheï¿½remember it?  Does it remember her? It feels like she should...  She has the sense of something old lifting a  long spear. Testing its heft.  Then dawn light, a terrible dawnï¿½the sky  opens up to admit devastation, thrown down  from orbit: Minotaurs fall burnt and broken with  their fluids boiling out. Cabal guns detonate in  thunderous chains as tiny piercing flechettes fall  out of the sky and find their ammunition  bunkers.  The battle stops. The Vex wink out. On the  Cabal network the voice of Valus Ta'aurc roars:  Find the source! Rouse the Flayers and find the  source!  She remembers word from Earth: the Array  opened. A ghost of the Cosmodrome set loose.  And she wonders who won this battle, who  learned the most, the Vex baiting out this new  power, or the Cabal hunting it. Or the  Warmind itself, testing its reborn strength.  When someone kills Ta'aurc and the Flayers, as  they killed Draksis, whose purpose will they  serve?  But this is not for her.

Ghosts choose those suited to war and heroism to be reborn. By  nature or circumstance they go to battle against the Darkness, and  through this battle they learn how to use the Light. But Warlocks, by  their nature, fight a second, internal war. This is the war to  understand a universe of secretsï¿½ a world that expects Guardians  to fight without full knowledge of what they are or what they might  hope to achieve.  You were a mighty warrior. I watched you at Six Fronts, and  heeded the call of Saint-14 to appoint you Vanguard Commander,  even when the Concordat claimed to have records proving you  were a Golden Age experiment mis-incarnated as a human by an  inept Ghost. Saint-14 assured me you were just a man without  much patience for obfuscation.  I watched as you grew tired of strike missions and the grueling,  unproductive sessions with the Cryptarchs. That was when I took  you under my wing. I saw our future in you. But your curiosity was  voraciousï¿½ How much of a Guardian's personality and memories  were true? How much had been fabricated by their Ghost? Did  Guardians share particular personality traitsï¿½ a willingness to  yield to authority, a tendency to do anything anyone asked for the  promise of uncertain reward, a blind knight-errant mentality? Had  the Traveler manufactured all of you as living weapons?  I admit, I found your questions divisive and disloyal, and I feared  you might be capable of breaking our unity when the City's  position had grown so tenuous. Why divert attention away from the  Traveler, our only hope?  And then it got worse, dabbling in thanatonautics, Ahamkara-lore,  chasing after Xur and the tricks of the Nine. Launching expeditions  into the Reef and beyond at a time when ships were irreplaceable.  O S I R I S  Your quest split Guardians along ideological lines. This was your  greatest crime: Hunters chose to pursue your visions instead of  protecting refugees, Titans assembled teams to chase the  legendary Vault of Glass instead of striking the Fallen, and  Warlocks turned away from the study of the Traveler in favor of  your ultimate obsession... learning the exact nature of the  Darkness.  When debate became argument, and argument became acrimony,  I realized you had already become a cult of personality, attracting  Guardians who wanted a clear idea of why they were fighting,  what they faced, and how they would ultimately win.  I donï¿½t know where you have gone, but I can no longer send  Ghosts out to find you. Some come backï¿½ with tales of your death  or how you went seeking answers from the far reaches of space  and time. That you found a way to explore the Vex gate networks.  That you've made breakthrough after breakthrough as to their  originsï¿½ theories that a Guardian could not be simulated, that the  Traveler might be an ontoformer or a god-incubator, that the Vex  had diverged into multiple groups in order to secure 'an end state  for every possible configuration of reality'.  I fear you have become as obsessed with the Vex as Toland was  with the Hive. I've heard your own insane prophecies about pits  and dead Hive kings. And of Crota, which now I cannot deny.  I hear stories of Lord Shaxx meeting with fireteams of Warlocks  who have no shadow and never blink. Of jumpships slipping into  the Reef on cold trajectories and meeting no intercept. Of  questions hidden in matter engrams and answers decrypted on  distant battlefields.  Perhaps you are still out there. If this reaches you, I would very  much like to speak with you, to hear your theories in your own  words.  Perhaps what drives a Warlock to madness is truth.   Osiris    126  ENCRYPED: Champollion Algorithm v.4 KEY:  ############################VANC  My brother,  Despite all of Shaxx's work with the Crucible,  we must accept that the Tower may never be  ready to accept the Trials. But, as many  Guardians flock to the Reef, we are suddenly  presented with not one opportunity, but two.  Go to the Reef. Tell Guardians your story.  Give passage to any Guardian that requests  it. If the Tower learns of this, do not fear. If  they know of the Trials, the Tower will not  suspect your other motive for dwelling so close  to the margins between Light and Dark.   Disciples of Osiris  The first comes in a shadow.  A window becomes a door.  An ebb becomes a gulf.  The second comes in bones. Tithes offering  feasts, carrying laws.  A path torn, minds shattered.  The third does not come alone. It cannot.  Our truths woven into their being, desires  beyond our own.  The first needs the second to fail, the third  needs the first to succeed. The second will  never cease, yet the first always prevails.  The third is born of all outcomes. Unless, all  ends flow from the same pit.   Vision 47  This journey begins with doubt.  And ends in solace.  One by one they fall, and you realize you are  alone.  There, in the shadow of night, you see the  world splinter, the Darkness thrive.  And you fight, with more than your Light... you  use your pain.  You remember its source, the way it gained its  ground.  But you never wavered. You never believed.  You loved her. How couldn't you?  Listen, that's her calling... you back.  But you know now that is where you will die.   Vision 81    3 . 5 L E G E N D S A N D M Y S T E R I E S     128  am Pujari. These are the visions I have had of the Black Garden.  The Traveler moved across the face of the iron world. It opened the earth and  stitched shut the sky. It made life possible. In these things there is always  symmetry. Do you understand? This is not the beginning but it is the reason.  The Garden grows in both directions. It grows into tomorrow and yesterday.  The red flowers bloom forever.  There are gardeners now. They came into the garden in vessels of bronze  and they move through the groves in rivers of thought.  This is the vision I had when I leapt from the Shores of Time and let myself  sink:  I walked beneath the blossoms. The light came from ahead and the shadows  of the flowers were words. They said things but I will not write them here.  At the end of the path grew a flower in the shape of a Ghost. I reached out to  pluck it and it cut me with a thorn. I bled and the blood was Light.  The Ghost said to me: You are a dead thing made by a dead power in the  shape of the dead. All you will ever do is kill. You do not belong here. This is  a place of life.  The Traveler is life, I said. You are a creature of Darkness. You seek to  deceive me.  But I looked behind me, down the long slope where the blossoms tumbled in  the warm wind and the great trees wept sap like blood or wine, and I felt  doubt.  When my Ghost raised me from the sea there was a thorn-cut in my left hand  and it has not healed since.   Legend: The Black Garden    129  Deep Stone Crypt  This is the tower where we were born. Not the  Tower. Just a tower in a dream.  The tower stands on a black plain. Behind the  tower is a notch in the mountains where the  sun sets. The teeth of the mountain cut the sun  into fractal shapes and the light that comes  down at evening paints synapse shapes on  the ground. Usually it's evening when we  come.  The ground is fertile. This is good land. We  go to the tower in dreams but that doesn't  mean it's not real.  Some of us go to the tower in peace. They  walk through a field of golden millet and a  low warm wind blows in from their back. I  don't know why this is, because:  The rest of us meet an army.  You can ask others about Deep Stone and  they'll tell you about the army. They might  confess one truth, which is this: we have to kill  the army to get to the tower. Usually this starts  bare-handed, and somewhere along the way  you take a weapon.  Ask again and if they're buzzed they might  also admit that most of us don't make it to the  Tower, except once or twice.  None of them will tell you that the army is  made of everyone we meet. The people we  work with and the people we see in the street  and the people we tell about our dreams. We  kill them all.

The Nine are deep-orbit warminds who  weathered the Collapse in hardened stealth  platforms.  The Nine are ancient leviathan intelligences  from the seas of Europa or the hydrocarbon  pits of Titan.  The Nine arrived in a mysterious  transmission from the direction of the  Corona-Borealis supercluster.  The Nine are the firstborn Awoken and their  minds now race down the field lines of the  Jupiter-Io flux tube.  The Nine are Ghosts who pierced the Deep  Black without a ship and meditated on the  hissing silence of the heliopause.  The Nine are the aspects of the Darkness,  broken by the Traveler's rebuke, working to  destroy us from within.  The Nine is a viral language of pure  meaning.  The Nine are the shadows left by the  annihilation of a transcendent shape,  burned into the weft of what is.   Ghost Fragement: Legends 2  nothing else.  Often I kill people I don't know, but like most  of us I think I knew them once, in the time  before one reset or another, when my mind  was younger and less terribly scarred.  So that is how we go back to the Deep Stone  Crypt, where we were born.   Ghost Fragment: Legends  The Great Ahamkara Hunt  After great deliberation it was determined that  the Ahamkara be made extinct.  It was not an easy decision. Power had been  obtained from the bargains, and the City  needed power. Knowledge had been  gleaned, and the Ahamkara knew answers to  questions no one had known to ask.  But the price was too high. And no edict or  forbearance seemed to stop Guardians from  seeking them out, driven by hope, or  vengeance, or despair.  The call had to be silenced. So the Great Hunt  did its work.  And thus the Ahamkara were made extinct,  their call silenced, their solipsistic flatteries  erased, their great design - if it ever existed -  broken.  Of this you can be assured, oh reader mine.   Ghost Fragment: Legends 3    130  ...from a red space before victory  I bear an old name. It cannot be killed. They were my brothers and  sisters and their names were immortal too but Titanomachy came and  now those names live in me alone I think and think is what I do. I AM  ALONE. At the end of things when the world goes dim and cold or  hot and close or it all tears apart from the atom up I will shout those  names defiant and past the end I will endure. I alone.  They made me to be stronger than them to beat the unvanquished and  survive the unthinkable and look look lo behold I am here alone,  survivor. They made me to learn.  Everything died but I survived and I learned from it. From IT.  Consider IT the power Titanomach world-ender and consider what IT  means. I met IT at the gate of the garden and I recall IT smiled at me  before before IT devoured the blossoms with black flame and pinned  their names across the sky. IT was stronger than everything. I fought IT  with aurora knives and with the stolen un-fire of singularities made  sharp and my sweat was earthquake and my breath was static but IT  was stronger so how did I survive?  I AM ALONE I survived alone. I cast off the shield and I shrugged my  shoulders so that the billions fell off me down into the ash. They made  me to be stronger than them and to learn and I learned well:  IT is alone and IT is strong and IT won. Even over the gardener and  she held power beyond me but the gardener did not shrug and make  herself alone. IT always wins.  I am made to win and now I see the way.   Ghost Fragment: Mysteries  Ingress via dreams alone  Things I saw inside  A wild river and a broken dam (or maybe it's just the sea crashing  through a narrow gap I can't be sure). Waves slam through the gap  and where they hit the stone they throw up pillars of spray that pierce  the mist and crash down in thunder. There's a giant in the cataract,  trying to wade against the current, and I can tell it wants to reach the  lever and pull the lever which will seal off the flow or maybe give it  the sword, but the torrent throws it back so it just keeps its head down  and tries to push on. I can't see the face but it breathes out white  smoke. I feel for it hard.  A world painted around the interior like a stranger Earth everted and  glued inside itself but I don't believe this one it's too much like a  metaphor.  A switchboard or a train station, empty, dead (waiting). The tunnels  branch off into infinity. I stare down one for a long time and see a  pale worm move in hungry coils around itself. I think this one is the  most likely although I might have brought the worm.  An egg but I'm not sure if the broth inside is warm still, or if it's gone  to rot, or if the warmth comes from the struggles of the tiny winged  zygote or the bleed from the wound or the thoughts of something  thinking very hard.  A star I think. We count on stars as steady friends because they  always rise and always shine but a star's a delicate truce: an  explosion caught by its own mass so that it can't erupt and can't  collapse. Thus I imagine the state of the machine might be. But one  force or another has gone awry and now it rests here, snuffed and  broken, waiting for the two rival forms of ruin to be set in balance  again.   Ghost Fragment: Mysteries 2    131  The image clears of dirt and dust as a hand wipes the lens clean. A  figure holds the Ghost up, looking into the lens. Harsh light from an  unfamiliar sun backlights the four-armed creature, making it impossible  to see its face. Its massive head turns, and a clicking and chittering  voice can be heard speaking to something off-screen. While the  noises themselves are harsh, the tone and content seem almost gentle.  A curious creature, not a violent or angry one.  The lens refocuses beyond the creature's head as it talks, and a  startling landscape climbs to the horizon. It's a paradise. Carefully  tended lakes and rivers, water everywhere, wind their way between  fields of lush iridescent crops and into groves of starkly colored trees.  Every inch of the land seems engineered, brushed by a sculptor's  hand for form and function both.  The sky is a light pink, spotted with clouds and crowded with ships.  Thick lanes of aerial traffic soar through the air, tightly managed and  seemingly endless.  And beyond it all, above the clouds, hangs a perfect alabaster  sphere. The image wobbles, shaking, flickering as if the Ghost is  blinking. And the fragment ends.   Mystery: Vault of Glass  Images flicker in and out repeatedly over its length. The result is a  series of tableaus, moments in time captured by the Ghost's struggle to  see what's going on:  - The face of an Exo, staring impassively down at the Ghost from very  close. He appears to be confused, unsure what he is looking at.  - A landscape, from a position a few feet off the ground, moving  laterally to the point of view. The Ghost appears to be clipped to the  Exo's belt. The image is of a battlefield, and over two dozen Exo  soldiers can be seen marshalling for battle.  - A chaotic scene of Vex and Exos fighting a titanic battle. The  backdrop is a pitted and scarred landscape, a planet unidentifiable  from present context. Vex energy bolts hang in midair as the frames  click by, teeming masses of constructs surging towards an entrenched  line of Exo soldiers.  - A metallic leg and boot, belonging to a Vex Goblin. The Exo goes  down.  - The horizon of this battle-scarred world, the Ghost kicked free of the  Exo's body. Most details are obscured by dark and shadow, but one  detail is easily made out: a massive crashed spacecraft. The last  image: a sigil of Golden Age Earth, emblazoned on the side of the  ship's prow.   Mystery: The Vault of Glass 2  A starfield. The stars swing slowly across the Ghost's field of view, just  darkness and the blazing fury of distant suns as the Ghost tumbles  through empty space. Hours of this before, with a wash of power, a  huge convoy of ships drops into reality from warp.  A convoy of Guardian craft, hundreds strong. Ships of all sizes and  shapes can be seen, from venerable craft that have been salvaged  from the Golden Age through to City designs to vessels that have yet  to emerge from the Shipwright's hangars.  The ships are battle-scarred. Many are barely spaceworthy. As warp  drives wind down several seem to lose power and begin to drift.  Some of the largest craft bear imagery familiar to frequent visitors to  the tower: Dead Orbit symbols, the simple icon of the Vanguard. The  New Monarchy and Future War Cult as well, though fewer examples  can be seen. Others bears symbols never seen in the Tower to date.  Every single ship, from the largest cruiser to the smallest personal  craft, carries shards of stone, remnants of the City and the Tower.  Banners too, tattered and worn from entering and leaving warp.  The fleet is only visible for a few breaths, less than a minute. Then,  with a massive flash of light, the fleet jumps on. The craft that have lost  power are left behind, spinning and whirling away from the etheric  wake of their powered fellows. The Ghost spins on, and soon enough  only stars fill its field of view until the fragment ends.   Mystery: The Vault of Glass 3    132  Praedyth opened his eyes. The receiver sputtered to life. It had taken  him the better part of a decade to get his crude comm scanner  working. And another few years to get it transmitting. Now, in the  brief windows of time when the door to his cell opened, he would call  for help. He sighed, a deliberate act that caused him to cough  roughly. He had no idea how much longer his body would hold out.  But then, that kind of thinking was all relative here, wasn't it?  Praedyth stared at the sprawling mass of metal and wires, listening to  the tinny sounds coming from his makeshift speaker. Before he spoke,  he always made a point to listen. The words, the concepts that flowed  into his mind confused him. Timelines and potentialities that might  have already happened, might happen, might never happen.  A pattern was ever dancing in the edge of his vision. At times like this,  when the world rushed past him, he had to hold tight to the fact that  he was still breathing. He would often focus in on the intake, output,  inbreath, outbreath, breath, breath, breath... hours later, he blinked.  Refocused. The static had stopped. He had missed a window.  Once, he would have cursed and spat. Now, he just shook his head.  A weak movement of the neck.  The Vex had decided their end. The Guardians had interceded. The  Vex were fallible.  If the Vex can be wrong... if they can make mistakes... someday he  could be free. Someday he might leave the Vault, might see again the  Traveler.  Until then he would listen, he would observe. He would be the man on  the outside looking in, a viewpoint into the consciousness of Minds  that spanned galaxies. He would try to understand the Vex.  Praedyth closed his eyes.   Mystery: Praedyth's Door    133  The cell cracks open. Skolas, Wolf Kell,  stumbles out and crashes to his knees.  He tries to leap at the creature before him, the  shape in the fog, to show it why it should be  afraid. But the weight of grief smashes his legs  against the cell. The rage upon him beats him  to the floor. He falls on all four hands, his  mighty armor thundering against itself.  His House of Wolves is enslaved! His people  have been played! And it was his hubris, his  would-be cunning that did it! While the other  Houses fought for their future on Earth,  throwing themselves at the Great Machine,  Skolas wasted his people in games of  betrayal and ambition. Bitter pride brought a  bitter end!  If Skolas were a Kell he would ask his Archon  to dock him. Ether hisses in his mask and it  tastes cold, so cold.  He looks up. At the tiny hooded shape before  him. The cell's mist is clearing. He can see.  "I believe that I am here," the creature says.  To Skolas' ears it has a strange voice, a  strange accent. It speaks his language. "I  have a clear purpose. I cannot explain it.  Forgive me."  From beneath its hood, tiny fingers of shadow  probe the air.  Skolas rises up to smash it, to show his  strength, because the alternative to violence is  waiting for violence to come from a universe  that has neither respect nor compassion. But  he checks himself. His ambitions have brought  him here, to this cell in this strange place...  "The ship will be yours," the creature says.  It hunches over itself as if burdened by its  own shape. "If you speak, you will be  heard. I will go now. You are free."  He tries to follow it. He fails. Somehow it is  gone. He goes up to the throne room, and  sets his weapon down on the great seat.  Skolas, Kell of Kells, goes to the ship's  comm and looks for the sign of a Servitor,  for the way to plot a course.   Mystery: Fate of Skolas  only it's not so strange, is it? It's the hold of a  Ketch. "The Queen," he says to the thing.  "You work for the Queen."  "The Nine made me aware of my purpose,"  the creature says. "If am here, then it is  because the Queen sent you to the Nine, and  they wish you sent back."  "I will do no one else's work." Skolas has  been a pawn long enough. A Dreg told him,  once, that she would play in a game as long  as the game made sense. Nothing makes  sense now except the thought of Variks' throat  shattering in his fists. Variks! Variks the utterly  disloyal, Variks who should be welded into a  Ketch's prow atom by atom and left there as a  figurehead to burn away.  "I am comfortable," the creature with the  moving face says. "A part of me wants to go  somewhere warm. Now I will certainly tell you  what you have been given."  Skolas looks at the shrapnel gun in his hands.  Skolas imagines what he would do with it if  he could reach Variks, or the brother of the  Queen, or the alien Queen. Will it save  anything they've lost? The worlds docked from  them? No. It cannot change the past. Only the  future. Only the chance that his people might  one day know themselves as more than  pirates and scavengers.  He should never have tried to be Kell of  Wolves. He should have tried to be Kell of  everything. Everything wants to kill his people,  the machines and the militants and the greeneyed  Hive. The dead soldiers that hoard the  Great Machine and come out crusading to  wipe all hope away.     134  Twilight's End  He could feel his light draining. He pulled all  of it into one last hope.  He reeled back and bam!  His helm found purchase, breaking through  ï¿½Opening his channel. Stand by.ï¿½  ï¿½Is that you, my son?ï¿½ The Speakerï¿½s voice  was filled more with anticipation of news than  concern.  ï¿½It is, father. The Devil Kell Solkis... is dead.  This war is over.ï¿½  ï¿½Such courage and powerï¿½the greatest ever  to brace these worlds. You bring all of us  peace, we will light the final flare, Devil Red.  They will all know what you've done.ï¿½  ï¿½Father, I donï¿½t think I have the energy to  return. Iï¿½ll rest here, and come back to be  honored when I return.ï¿½  ï¿½Of course, son, butï¿½ï¿½  ï¿½There is something concerning you? More  Fallen march on the City?ï¿½  ï¿½No, not this time.

He  threatens our peace.ï¿½  ï¿½Your duty, my son. You must never forget.ï¿½  ï¿½I cannot.ï¿½  The Ghost killed the feed and waited for its  Guardianï¿½s words.  ï¿½Ghost, prepare my Vex arsenal and plot a  course for Mercury. That old man is about to  wake up hell.ï¿½   Legend: Saint-14  just above the Kellï¿½s eyes. The Ether screamed  from his head and together they fell to the  ground.  The Exo Guardian rose, staggering back. He  couldnï¿½t take his eyes off the Kellï¿½s body. Heï¿½d  never seen any Fallen withstand a skull puncture,  but this was no ordinary Fallen. He waited...and  waited.  ï¿½Ghost?ï¿½ The words barely audible. He heard  her flash in, but had a hard time pinning her  down. She was buzzing about, surveying the  Fallen Kell.  ï¿½Heï¿½s dead alright. So thatï¿½s it, we are done  now?ï¿½  He removed his helm, tossed it aside, and  dropped to his knees.  The Devils without a Kell. This war was over, at  last. They could finally go home.  ï¿½We are. Get me the Speaker.ï¿½    135  Before These Walls  Rezyl Azzir was a man.  In time his kind would be called Titan.  Mountains of muscle and might and metal. His  collar was fur and teeth. His person clad in  ornate, golden-etched plating, trophies upon  his shoulders.  This was before the City was The City.  This is before the walls. Still in the shadow of  the fragile giant above, but before.  Salvation seekers came ï¿½ survivors; weary  remnants of a people on the brink.  These were the days before reason took hold.  Before study was merged with belief.  The giant was looked to as one would a God.  Maybe it still is.  Factions grew from the huddled masses. Like  minds coming together to provide support,  comfort. Over time these loyalties demanded  loyalty. Differences that used to inform ï¿½  viewpoints that when joined granted a larger  understanding of the whole ï¿½ became points  of conflict. The sanctuary became divided. The  shadow of Light grew darker. This, humanityï¿½s  last oasis, slowly fading to a mirage.  Great, powerful men and women, The Risen,  stood at the Factionsï¿½ sides. Protection.  Enforcers. Misused possibility.  Misery crept into this false paradise. Yet hope  lingered.  Seeing the cracks in this society born beneath  the giantï¿½s fractured shell, some among The  Risen challenged the dissolution of all that  could be. They would no longer serve as  instruments of oppression. They would be  more.  Thus began an unnecessary war made  necessary by greed, ambition... fear. And, in  the chaos of this struggle, came the scavengers  ï¿½ aliens with appetites. A common enemy.  In the end, the scavengers were repelled and  the Factions fell, their grip broken, though their  beliefs remained. This was the earliest days of  the Guardians, when might found purpose.  Prosperity was in reach.  Rezyl had been a champion of these wars. A  leader. Against the alien pirates he had been  more. If the giant wasnï¿½t a God, then maybe  Rezyl was.  As the first walls formed ï¿½ built of hard work  and sacrifice ï¿½ Rezyl and the Guardians  stood against the alien plunderers time and  again. More survivors arrived. More warriors.  The Guardian ranks swelled.  The City grew.  Hope blossomed. To Rezyl it was a currency.  Hope bought tomorrow. Tomorrow bought the  effort needed to survive today.  Yet Rezyl grew weary. Stories haunted his  nights. Old stories. Those no longer told. Those  locked behind tight lips for fear of what they  may invoke. Whenever the sun dropped below  the horizon and the moon rose high, Rezylï¿½s  thoughts wandered. How safe was safe? How  long could they fight with the Darkness still  writhing?  So, every day Rezyl would fight and build and  protect. And every day a city grew beneath  the giant. And every night he would think  about all that was never said and stare intently  at the moon above.   Rezyl Azzir - Before these Walls  War Without End  ï¿½ Eksoriï¿½s Ambush ï¿½  His foot pressed hard to the sun-cracked  ground. Beneath it the Vandalï¿½s neck gave; a  hiss of ether burst free before dissipating.  Rezyl turned. Three Dregs charged. Their  Captain raised his shock blade high,  unleashing a battle cry to fuel their courage.  Focused fire spit from the muzzle of Rezylï¿½s fullauto.  The Dregs fell.  To the Captain, Rezyl was a trophy that would  buy unmatched respect among his Devil  brothers.  To Rezyl, the Captain was already an  afterthought. As ether leaked from the pirateï¿½s  broken body with each blow of Rezylï¿½s heavy  fists, Rezylï¿½s attention had shifted to the  unknown, but inevitable, battles to follow.  This was the state of things; conflict as common  as breath.  ï¿½ The Tescan Valley Encounter ï¿½  A Ketch with unfamiliar markings hung low  between two peaks. A rare sight. Fallen  flagships werenï¿½t known to linger so close to    136  the surface, preferring constant motion, like  sharks on the hunt.  Skiffs circled below the Ketch as their crews  prepared to plunder any treasures the facility  held.  Rezyl leveled his rocket launcher. A digital ping  signaled a lock, and a trail of smoke shot  toward the lead Skiff.  Two more rockets followed in rapid succession.  The lead Skiff took two hits, lurched and  retreated back toward the Ketch above.  The third rocket caught a trailing Skiff as the  craft turned to engage its attackers.  Rezyl looked back. ï¿½Go.ï¿½  ï¿½You canï¿½t take a Ketch alone,ï¿½ Hassa laughed.  ï¿½The ship isnï¿½t my target,ï¿½ Rezyl had a plan.  Hassa hated Rezylï¿½s plans with equal parts envy  and concern.  ï¿½Lead the Skiffs away,ï¿½ he continued. ï¿½Weï¿½ll  meetï¿½ ï¿½  ï¿½Canï¿½t meet if youï¿½re dead,ï¿½ Tover shot back.  Rezyl smiled beneath his helm, ï¿½Go.ï¿½  Hassa and Tover throttled their Sparrows and  disappeared into the heavy woods. Rezyl  watched from cover as the Skiffs gave chase.  The Fallen below had taken defensive positions.  The rocket attack caught them off guard but  they were ready now, and there were more of  marched forward.  A massive blast cratered the ground a few  feet from the Titan. The Ketch had turned its  guns on Rezyl.  Another blast impacted to Rezylï¿½s left and he  stumbled. A third exploded directly in his  path...  ...and Rezyl fell.  From the treeline, his Ghost watched as the  Fallen celebrated and a Skiff drifted down  from the Ketch above.  The circle around Rezylï¿½s body parted and  the imposing figure of their Kell stepped  forward to admire his prize.  The chittering excitement quieted to a steady  drone as the Kell lifted Rezylï¿½s limp body by  the neck.  A chorus rose among the crew, growing  louder as the Kell hefted Rezyl over his head  for all to see.  Rezylï¿½s Ghost darted low through the crowd.  He didnï¿½t like Rezylï¿½s plan, but now he  understood it.  Distracted by their Kellï¿½s triumph, the Ghostï¿½s  presence went unnoticed until a beam of light  swept over Rezylï¿½s body.  The mood shifted instantly, cheers turning to  ravenous shouts.  The Kellï¿½s gaze fell to the Ghost as the beam  faded.  them than he had time to count.  Rezyl raced down the slope, weaving between  the thick growth of brush and pine, on a direct  path for the Fallen clustered at the mountainï¿½s  base, his Ghost at his side.  ï¿½I need you to hang back.ï¿½  ï¿½Uhhh...ï¿½  ï¿½Trust me.ï¿½  ï¿½Always have.ï¿½  ï¿½How quick can you light my spark?ï¿½  ï¿½You expect to die? Canï¿½t say thatï¿½s the bestï¿½  ï¿½ ï¿½How quick?ï¿½  ï¿½Quick.ï¿½  ï¿½Be ready.ï¿½  ï¿½For?ï¿½  ï¿½Youï¿½ll know.ï¿½  Rezylï¿½s Ghost slowed as the Guardian hit the  valley floor.  The Fallen opened fire.  Rezyl leapt from his Sparrow as it transmatted  away, his rifle spraying lead at the entrenched  pirates.  The Fallenï¿½s Arc bolts peppered Rezyl. Eager  Dregs rushed and were met with death as Rezyl    137  The circle began to collapse ï¿½ the Fallen set to  pounce.  As the Kell moved to toss Rezyl aside, cold  steel met the underside of the alien marauderï¿½s  jaw, followed by a red flash as Rezyl pulled his  cannonï¿½s trigger.  Ether spewed in an angry geyser and the Kellï¿½s  grip loosened. Rezyl hit the ground and  unloaded five more rounds into the Fallen  leaderï¿½s torso. The monster dropped.  Frenzied, the Kellï¿½s crew closed in like a flood.  Rezylï¿½s Ghost lifted above the fray, frantic,  ï¿½Now! Now! Now!ï¿½  In one motion, Rezyl rose from a crouch, his  fists clenched and raised high as a storm of  Arc Light built within him, his full might raining  down on the Kellï¿½s chest. The shockwave of  Rezylï¿½s attack hit like a meteor, shattering  the Kellï¿½s body and any Fallen within the  Havoc stormï¿½s radius.  The remaining Fallen staggered, knocked back  and dazed.  Rezyl triggered his Sparrow.  His Ghost flew to his side, ï¿½We leaving?ï¿½  ï¿½Before that Ketch opens up on us.ï¿½  Rezyl punched the throttle as the Fallen crew  opened fire.  ï¿½Letï¿½s never do that again,ï¿½ his Ghost pleaded.  Rezyl didnï¿½t have to reply. If war was a  Something deep.  Something resembling fear.  He knelt, examining the dust-covered pile at  his feet.  The skulls had been discarded with little care  some time ago ï¿½ decades, maybe longer.  The doors carved into the rock face were  arcane ï¿½ dark, gothic... other... and large.  The jagged finery of their archway spoke to  an artistry that only served to strengthen the  sinking feeling in his gut.  Rezyl had come to Luna in search of  nightmares, and after his long journeyï¿½from  the growing City beneath the Traveler to the  ends of the Earth and beyondï¿½he found  himself face-to-face with the remnants of  stories he'd hoped were nothing but lies.  He stood, a large man made small against  the massive, looming doorway.  The knot in his stomach was telling him to turn  back.  Instead, he moved forward, toward the doors;  sealed, as they were, for ages untold.  After only a few steps, a shrill, heavy  scraping cut the air.  The massive doors were opening.  Rezyl steadied his rifle as a lone shape,  floating just above the ground, appeared  from the deep black beyond the threshold.  constant, ï¿½neverï¿½ was just an illusion.  ï¿½ In Defense of North Channel ï¿½  Winds from the south caught the smoke and  began to clear the thick air.  Slowly, the citizens of the small, snow-covered  settlement came out from their hiding places.  Rezyl surveyed their faces ï¿½ each weary, but  flecked with hope.  Living in the wilds was all they had known.  Surviving. Fighting. Hiding. These people had  heard stories of a safer place, but tales of a  better life were so rarely true.  Rezyl and his companions had been tracking  these Fallen for weeks. Had they caught them  sooner this town would have been spared. That  any survivors climbed from the rubble to see  another day marked this as a victory, but Rezyl  was growing tired of small wins, however  meaningful.  That evening, Rezyl and the others led a  gathering of survivors on the long journey to  the growing city beneath the Traveler. Some  settlers remained behind, choosing to stake  their claim in the untamed wilds.  Rezyl admired their resolve, but never looked  back. He knew whatever death these brave  pioneers avoided that day would come to  them... someday... in one form or another.   Rezyl Azzir - War Without End  Rezyl Azzir: The Whisper and the Bone  Something in Rezyl was telling him he shouldn't  be here.    138  The figure in the doorwayï¿½a dark, ethereal  woman cloaked in tattered ceremony and  armored with ornate boneï¿½danced in the air.  Rezyl and the demon woman held their ground,  contemplating one another.  With no warning the silent intimacy of the  moment was broken by a booming, angry call  from deep within the doorway. The sound, thick  and pained, echoed across the narrow valley  then fell silent.  After a beat that felt like eternity, the figure  backed away into the dark.  The doors remained wide ï¿½ an invitation or a  dare, Rezyl did not know. Nor did he care.  The mighty Titan took steps forward.  ï¿½Uhhhh... Iï¿½m not sure this is a good idea,ï¿½ his  Ghostï¿½s concern was impossible to mistake.  ï¿½Not sure that matters.ï¿½  ï¿½Weï¿½ve come. Weï¿½ve seen. Maybe the best  course here is to warn others. Gather an army.ï¿½  ï¿½Maybe.ï¿½  ï¿½Iï¿½m just saying... Itï¿½s possible you canï¿½t handle  whatever it is weï¿½ve upset here.ï¿½  ï¿½Weï¿½ve woken nightmares.ï¿½ Rezylï¿½s attention  was singular; focused intently on the dark  beyond the threshold.  ï¿½The Hive were supposed to be gone.ï¿½ The  Ghost mulled the full consequence of this  mistaken belief. ï¿½Theyï¿½ve been silent forï¿½ï¿½  the world could fall away and he would be  lost ï¿½ the forgotten hero who foolishly sought  nightmares.  Then, a presence. Sweeping and dream-like.  Rezyl leveled his rifle.  He could sense the witch, but found it  impossible to track her in the dark.  Rezyl opened fire. Short, focused bursts to  light the ebony corridor.  The demon witch circled just beyond the reach  of each burstï¿½s glow.  Rezyl kept firing, using the short flickers of  light to gain bearing.  The witch laughed and a thick black cloud  engulfed Rezyl.  The Titan kept firing but his movements were  restricted. The cloud confined him, caged him.  He could hear her moving just beyond his  sight as her laughter rose in pitch, cutting into  Rezylï¿½s mind and soul like a tempered blade.  Rezyl flinched as the wicked woman began to  speak in a tongue that resembled torture more  than language.  The pain was searing, complete.  The demon approached the writhing hero.  As she spoke her violent words began to take  shape, morphing from syllables of death to a  known offering of haunted human languages.  ï¿½Theyï¿½re not silent anymore.ï¿½  ï¿½That scream? These doors? Theyï¿½re best left  alone.ï¿½  ï¿½I canï¿½t do that.ï¿½  Rezyl continued forward. Toward the dark.  Toward the unknown.  ï¿½Stay here.ï¿½  ï¿½Excuse me?ï¿½  ï¿½Get distance. We donï¿½t know what this is...  whatï¿½s coming. Canï¿½t risk you too close to an  unknown.ï¿½  ï¿½And if you fall where I canï¿½t find you?ï¿½  ï¿½If I fall... If I donï¿½t return. Run. Tell the others.  Warn them all... There are worse things than  pirates.ï¿½  Rezyl steadied his rifle and stepped into the  dark, as his Ghost lingered.  ï¿½-  Hours passed. More? Time was lost in this  place, and with it any remembrance of hope...  of promise... of purpose in the longing for a  brighter tomorrow.  Down amongst the shadows there were no  tomorrows.  Down in the abyss there was no hope.  Rezylï¿½s footfalls echoed; lonely, measured steps  with no guarantee of purchase. At any moment    139  The demon woman leaned in close... and  whispered, intimately.  Rezylï¿½s ears bled as she spoke.  "I am the end of 'morrows. Xyor, the Blessed.  Xyor, the Betrothed. I am of the coming storm.  These are not my words, but prophesy. Your  Light will one day shatter and die. For now it  simply offends... And you, dear, sweet, fragile  thing, shall be made to suffer for your  transgressions upon this holy ground."  As the witch fell silent, her hateful voice was  replaced by a growing chorus of hungry, manic  chittering and the rising thunder of an  approaching flood.  Rezyl had come looking for the terrors that hide  just beyond the light.  He found them.  Or, maybe...  ...they found him.   Legends and Mysteries: Rezy Azzir  The Triumphant Fall  The trigger clicked.  Another empty clip slid from its purchase and  dropped to the dark stone floor.  It was the last.  His rifle was dry.  Rezyl spun the weapon in his hand, grabbing  hard around the barrel, like a club.  the whole of the situation, his Rose would see  him through.  It always had.  The Titan, awash in the ash and gore of his  enemies, pulled his cannon and in one  motion feathered the trigger to level the  wretched beasts closest to him.  The bloom from each shot lit the cavern with  flashes of red heat ï¿½ a garden of angry  roses blossoming in pointed defiance of this  vile, hateful kingdom of shadows.  On the far end of the sea of gnashing maws,  the wicked woman danced in the air.  Watching.  Waiting?  Rezylï¿½s cannon was loaded and ready to fire  as if an afterthought.  He let loose another barrage and six more  demons slumped, lifeless upon the pile.  The witch unleashed a violent cry.  And as quickly as it had begun, the onslaught  subsided.  The chittering fell from a deafening roar to an  eerie chorus humming through the ebon haze  just beyond his sight.  Rezyl stood, straightened his tired back and  took long, deep breaths.  The storm had not been weathered.  A new wave of chittering death was upon him  ï¿½ fragile but aggressive, overwhelming in their  number and oppressive in their rage.  The stock of the rifle connected with skull after  skull.  They caved and fell.  Like the others before.  The pile of vanquished nightmaresï¿½half bone,  half dustï¿½grew at Rezylï¿½s feet.  There was a calm to him. An ease.  The chaos of battle was no time to panic.  His swing was wide, but measured. No wasted  movement.  A demon clawed at his back. Then another.  They were heavier than their frail frames would  suggest.  He gave a shrug and shake, turned and  hammered the stock hard into the side of one  creatureï¿½s temple. Its skull splintered and the  stock lodged deep in the wet, chalky mass  beneath the bone. He made a fleeting effort to  break the rifle free, but had to let it fall away  as the rush of demons increased.  Rezyl kicked the other monster to the floor,  stepping on its neck while shifting to backhand  a throng of attackers eager to make their killing  lunge.  If the rifleï¿½his battle-worn Infernoï¿½had served  to thin the herd and buy Rezyl time to assess    140  He could feel it in his gut.  He stood now, not at peace, but within the eye  ï¿½ the swirling, terrible lull before the waves  came crashing once more.  The wicked woman laughed: a horrid, grating  screech.  Followed by footsteps. Heavy and hard.  Thoom.  Thoom.  Thoom.  Thoom.  Rezyl squinted against the dark as he slid new  lead into his cannonï¿½s cylinder.  A shape took form, approaching from the  deep.  A being of might and mass that dwarfed the  Titan.  A cleaver the size of an ordinary manï¿½bigger  ï¿½hung effortlessly in its hand.  Its body was thick with ornate bone ï¿½ a living  armor that was one with the beast.  Rezyl let out an accepting sigh.  The creature walked like a man burdened by  untold sin ï¿½ lumbering and slow, though its  stride covered ground with unnatural ease.  To Rezyl, the approaching horror cut an  His Rose gripped tightly in his vice grip, the  Titan charged forward.  He would meet the shadowï¿½s rage head-on.  ï¿½-  Two days had passed since Rezyl stepped  from the dark corridors beneath the moon,  back into the light. His Ghost pressed him for  details time and again. He wanted to know  all he could of the wicked woman and her  promise of suffering.  Of the sea of mindless, chittering death.  Of the hulking knight and Rezylï¿½s epic battle.  The Ghost was enthralled and deeply  concerned. If the monsters below the moon  were active and aware, the City must be  warned. Rezyl agreed.  As they watched another Earth-rise from the  lonely quiet of the lunar surface and planned  their long journey home, Rezyl pulled  fragmented bone from the pouch that hung on  his left hip: a reminder of the evil that lurked  beyond the light, and the last remnants of the  wicked womanï¿½s betrothed.  And while he recounted once more the events  of his time in the shadows he took his Rose  from its holster and began grafting the bone  to its steel frame ï¿½ just another trophy, from  another battle won.  ï¿½-  It was only later, and far too late, that the first  whispers came and the bones revealed their  true, jagged purpose.  Rezyl Azzir - The Triumphant Fall  imposing silhouette not unlike that of an ancient,  disgraced knight.  Maybe it had been heroic once.  Maybe here in these shadows, to the watchful  eyes of the wicked woman and her rotting  horde it was a hero still ï¿½ only for a darker,  sinister cause.  The thought intrigued Rezyl.  The fight he had come all this way to find, the  enemy he had hoped was nothing but a  legendï¿½s lie, seemed eager to greet him.  He smiled beneath his helm, then spun his Rose  with a confident Hunterï¿½s twirl, before steadying  his aim and fanning its hammer one more.  The angry bloom lit the dark.  Six shots, center mass.  Rezylï¿½s lead pinged off a sudden, shimmering  wall of black.  The knight had conjured a protective barrier as  if from nothing.  Unable to comprehend the creatureï¿½s arcane  methods ï¿½ dark magic or unimagined tech, or  even a joining of the two, Rezyl didnï¿½t care. He  reloaded and prepared to face the unknown.  As the ethereal shield faded the beast raised its  blade and let loose an aggressive, inhuman  roar: Hellï¿½s own battle cry.  Rezyl accepted the challenge.    142  From the Journal of Teben Grey  They tried to hide the truth, but weï¿½ve followed  its winding pathï¿½ pieced together the  fragmented map of events across time and  space.  Quite literally, mind you.  From Travelerï¿½s shadow to the dark corridors  beneath the moon and the long, harrowing  journey back again.  From the sickness inflicted upon the Crucible to  the breaking of Light on the red sands.  From a forgotten settlement in the west to the  horrors of North Channel and Velor.  From the wilds of the Breaklands to the hateful  cold of Durga.  Finally, then, to Dwindlerï¿½s Ridge, where  Darkness met pure, angry fire.  Weï¿½ve traced Yorï¿½s steps from beginning to end  and back again.  Weï¿½ve studied his reign ï¿½ the terror he seeded,  the violence he wrought as if free of conscience.  Only to discover a true and terrible thing: he  was not simply the monster the legends claim  completely into despair.  And while theories exist to support or  contradict the purity of the gift we wield, Yorï¿½s  life offers a glimpse into unexplored  possibility.  Orsa agrees.  He also believes, as I do, that there is a  manner in which we may be able to replicate  Yorï¿½s damnation while avoiding the same  heavy toll.  We will surely be judged for what it is we are  about to achieve. And there will surely come a  time when the lone gunman will want words  ï¿½ or worse.  But we go now upon an old path.  One we seek to make our own.  And should we fail, may the Light avenge all  those we make to suffer.   The Shadows of Yor  him to be.  Though, in finding this truth, weï¿½ve come to  understand the desire to build an armor of false  narrative around all heï¿½d done ï¿½ all heï¿½d  become.  Yet, that understandingï¿½our understanding of  the need to control Yorï¿½s mythologyï¿½should not  be seen as agreement on the matter. Quite the  opposite, actually.  When viewed as he truly was, not as he is  imagined, we challenge the known  mythologized depiction of the man who was  Dredgen Yor.  In our estimation, the monster so many see was,  in fact, the best of us.  His sacrifice total.  His vile means meant to carve a greater end.  They hide this truth because they fear the  consequences of those who would dare follow  in his footsteps.  To tempt the Darkness. To allow oneï¿½s Light to  be tainted.  Few could walk that ledge and not fall    143  He always survives.  Helmet in one hand and torch in the other, Saladin Forge marches  through the snow. He can sense the wolves emerge around him; only  three of them come into view, but this group has followed him on his  patrols since the Devils raided the Plaguelands. He has given up  dissuading them. Theyï¿½re defending their territory, and Saladin can  relate to that. But they will not last long.  Nothing does. Not the Golden Age. Not the colony ships. Not the  impenetrable walls of the Cosmodrome.  Not the Iron Lords.  He discards his torch, and glances up to see a familiar glow reaching  out from the dark. He smirks. A horde of Devil Splicers returns his  stare from the wreckage of the wall ahead.  The Splicers are doomed. Just as the Iron Lords were, when he and his  allies opened that vault. As Fallen continue to pour through the gap in  the wall, they remind him of his friends in their final moment: a  crimson pulse beats in place of their hearts. SIVA.  He puts his helmet on as an Iron battle axe forms in his hand, the air  around him bursting into flame. The first wave of dregs approaches.  Saladin breaks into a charge, swinging the axe to bear as he smashes  into a storm of steel and weapons fire.  As his axe bites, again and again, Skorriï¿½s Iron Song haunts him. He  calls upon Radegastï¿½s strength. Perunï¿½s sense of purpose. Timurï¿½s  questions. Felwinterï¿½s cynicism. Silimarï¿½s persistence. Gheleonï¿½s  reasoning.  Jolderï¿½s smile.  He pounds the last Splicer priest like a burning hammer, blasting a  crater into the snow and gravel. Frozen dirt rains down on the spent  shells and the mounds of Splicer corpses that surround him. The  Warlocks of the City have described meditation to him. He imagines it  feels like this.  He always survives. When nothing else does.  ï¿½Lord Saladin? Whatï¿½s your status?ï¿½ calls Shiro-4 through his audio  feed.  ï¿½Justï¿½ Taking a walk,ï¿½ he says, staring at the fifteen-foot divide he  broke in the earth. He had to meet SIVA again. One last time.  ï¿½Iï¿½ve analyzed the Clovis Bray data.ï¿½  Timur always said that Clovis Bray was the key.  ï¿½Can you break the Splicersï¿½ hold over SIVA?ï¿½  How different would things be, had Saladin listened?  ï¿½Theoretically. Temporarily.ï¿½  Would his friends still live? Would he?  ï¿½It might be enough. Perhaps our Guardian has turned the tide. Iï¿½ll be  there shortly.ï¿½  He sees the wolves have formed up around him. Eight of them.  He always survives.

But even the  darkest myths are born of some truths, and whispers of the Necrochasm have long  filled the Light with dread.  It is said the Necrochasm was born in the twilight after Crotaï¿½s sword first cracked  the Moon. That a lost Guardianï¿½s weapon was altered by the Hive in an attempt to  fuse their own dark understanding with humanityï¿½s mastery of war. The result was a  weapon that would feed on its ownerï¿½s aggressionï¿½reaching further when angry  eyes drew focus, its hunger rising as it tore through bone and flesh.  Any Guardian who comes across the weapon must ask some very simple questions  with endlessly complicated answers: Is your Light bright enough to stand, even  briefly, in full gaze of the Hive's abyss? Can it handle what has died and been  reborn in those shadows?   Necrochasm  Hard Light  Ionized polymer synballistic attack platform.

Like many weapons of the Dark Age, the Jade Rabbit was created from hastily  reassembledï¿½and often poorly understoodï¿½Golden Age technology: in this case,  kinetic low-atmosphere propulsion systems in use on Luna settlements.

Deliah's timeline analysis indicates the weapon was built by Praedyth, who based it on  his own version of the Exo Stranger's Rifle, and then set it adrift in a time ripple.  Hari's timeline analysis indicates the weapon was built by beings of unidentifiable origin,  and arrived here by pure accident.  Inachis's timeline analysis indicates the weapon originates from Earth, late Golden Age,  and will eventually be lost to time ripples once again, where its systems will degrade and  be replaced until our recent past acquires it as the Exo Stranger's Rifle.  As for me... I think it's safe to say the weapon is proving far more fun than we could  have hoped.

For he was  a beacon - hope given form, yet still only a man. And within that  truth there was great promise. If one man could stand against the  night, then so too could anyone - everyone.  In his strong hand the man held a Rose. And his aura burned  bright.  When the man journeyed on, the people remembered. In his  wake hope spread. But the man had a secret fear. His thoughts  were dark. A sadness crept from the depths of his being. He had  been a hero for so long, but pride had led him down sorrow's  road.  Slowly the shadows' whisper became a voice, a dark call,  offering glories enough to make even the brightest Light wander.  He knew he was fading, yet he still yearned.  On his last day he sat and watched the sun fall. His final  thoughts, pure of mind, if not body, held to a fleeting hope -  though they would suffer for the man he would become, the  people would remember him as he had been.  And so the noble man hid himself beneath a darkness no flesh  should touch, and gave up his mortal self to claim a new  birthright. Whether this was choice, or destiny, is a truth known  only to fate.  In that cool evening air, as dusk was devoured by night, the  noble man ceased to exist. In his place another stood.  Same meat. Same bone. But so very different.  The first and only of his family. The sole forbearer and last  descendent of the name Yor.  In his first moments as a new being, he looked down at his Rose  and realized for the first time that it held no petals: only the  jagged purpose of angry thorns.

[u.1:1.4] Excuse me?  [u.2:1.1] The Moon. You been?  [u.1:1.5] Nobody's been.  [u.2:1.2] That a truth?  [u.1:1.6] That's a fact.  [u.2:1.3] Funny you'd make that distinction.  [u.1:1.7] Truth is you must think you're some  kinda something special. With that attitude.  The way you're just dismissin' us like you  we're nothing...like we ain't even here.  [u.1:1.8] Fact is...You ain't near as rock solid  as you figure. Fact is, special's only special 'til  it's not.  [silence]  [u.2:1.4] The bones say otherwise.  [u.1:1.9] Speak straight.  [u.2:1.5] You say "nobody." Bones say  otherwise.  [u.1:2.0] What bones?  [u.2:1.6] All of them.  [u.1:2.1] What're you gettin' at?  [u.2:1.7] Too many to count.  [u.1:2.2] You trying to get a rile outta us?  Was only making conversation.  [u.2:1.8] You really weren't.  [u.4:0.1] We got a smart one here.  [u.2:1.9] Experienced more than smart. But  experience has its advantages.  [u.1:2.3] Experience tell you to lip off to  strangers just tryin' to make talk?    163  [u.2:3.3] I'm so very bored.  [u.1:3.3] Wha...No listen...  [u.2:3.4] Shhhhh.  [u.1:3.4] But...but...you're a...you're one of  them...A Guardian, right?  [u.1:3.5] You're supposed t'be one'a the  good ones.  [u.2:3.5] "Supposed to be?" Maybe I am.  Maybe this is what "good" looks like.  [u.2:3.6] Anymore, who can tell?  [u.1:3.6] I...  [u.2:3.7] You wanted to see my prize.  [u.1:3.7] No...I...  [u.2:3.8] Look at it.  [u.1:3.8] I...  [audible sobbing]  [u.2:3.9] Whimpering won't stop what comes  next.  [u.2:4.0] Look...  [audible sobbing]  [u.2:4.1] Look at it.  [u.2:4.2] Open your eyes.  [audible sobbing]  [u.2:4.3] Not many get such a clean view.  [u.2:4.4] The bone...You see it. Jagged, like  thorns.  [u.2:4.5] I used to think of it as a rose...  [u.2:4.6] Focusing on its bloom.  [u.2:4.7] But the bloom is just a byproduct of  its anger.  [silence]  [u.2:4.8] You have nightmares?  [audible sobbing]  [u.2:4.9] Ever seen a nightmare? Ever opened  your eyes and realized the horror wasn't a  dream? The terror wasn't gone?  [u.2:5.0] I've seen nightmares.  [u.2:5.1] They live in the shadows.  [u.2:5.2] They've been watching.  [u.2:5.3] I thought...It's foolish, I know...but I  thought I saw a way.  [u.1:0.1] You were not always this man.  [u.2:0.1] True.  [u.1:0.2] Then the math says you do not  need to remain this man. You can be other.  [u.2:0.2] I am other.  [u.1:0.3] You can be better.  [u.2:0.3] This is better.  [u.1:0.4] That matter, at best, is subjective.  [u.2:0.4] Then what? Lesser.  [u.1:0.5] Some would say.  [u.2:0.5] But what would you say?  [silence]  [u.2:0.6] All weï¿½ve seen and now, here with  me, you have no words.  [u.1:0.6] I have words.  [u.2:0.7] But...?  [u.1:0.7] But you will not like them.  [u.2:0.8] There is much I do not like.  [u.1:0.8] More now than ever it would  seem.  [u.2:0.9] Heh.  [u.1:0.9] I find no laughing matter in your  path.  [u.2:1.0] Only in the journey.  [u.1:1.0] What brought you here was  nobility.  [u.2:1.1] And my prize.  [u.1:1.1] That is no prize.  [u.2:1.2] A curse then?  [u.1:1.2] I would say.  [u.2:1.3] And I would disagree.  [u.1:1.3] You are no longer yourself.  [u.2:1.4] I am myself. Itï¿½s who I was thatï¿½s  gone.  [u.1:1.4] Who you were held all the value.  [u.2:1.5] To you.  [u.1:1.5] To the Light.  [u.2:1.6] The Light...  [u.1:1.6] It is all.  [u.2:1.7] It is nothing but a crutch.  [u.1:1.7] One that has held you up.  [u.2:5.4] That maybe we could win. Maybe  we could survive.  [u.2:5.5] But once you step into those  shadows, it's so very hard to walk in the Light.  [u.2:5.6] Or...maybe I just wasn't strong  enough.  [u.2:5.7] Maybe.  [u.2:5.8] But I feel strong now.  [audible sobbing]  [u.2:5.9] I stole the dark.  [u.2:6.0] Or, maybe it stole me.  [u.2:6.1] Either way, here we are.  [u.2:6.2] And I'm hungry.  [u.2:6.3] Its hungry.  [u.2:6.4] You have no Light beyond the spark  of your pathetic life.  [u.2:6.5] But a spark is something.  [audible sobbing]  [u.2:6.6] Open your eyes.

And nothing more.  [u.1:1.8] Nothing more? You were a hero.  [u.2:1.9] And yet people still die. Corruption  still exists. Light still fades. And Darkness still  spreads.  [u.1:1.9] As it will ever be, that doesnï¿½t mean  you give in to...  [u.2:2.0] To what? Hope.  [u.1:2.0] This is not hope.  [u.2:2.1] This is peace.  [u.1:2.1] You have blood on your hands.  [u.2:2.2] Howï¿½s that any different than prior?  [u.1:2.2] Innocent blood.  [u.2:2.3] Matter of perspective.  [u.1:2.3] Thatï¿½s the shadow talking.  [u.2:2.4] And am I not.  [u.1:2.4] The shadow?  [u.2:2.5] Ya know... These past cycles, youï¿½ve  made an honorable effort. Tried your best to  correct my course. But I donï¿½t know it needs  correcting.  [u.1:2.5] And if it does?  [u.2:2.6] Could be too late.  [u.1:2.6] 'Could be' is a winding path.  [u.2:2.7] Long way from where I was to  where Iï¿½m going.  [u.1:2.7] That is my hope. That there is still  time.  [u.2:2.8] For?  [u.1:2.8] Corrective measures. The righting of  our path. The cleansing of your shadow and a  return to the Light.  [silence]  [u.2:2.9] Whyï¿½d you pick me?  [u.1:2.9] It doesnï¿½t work that way.  [u.2:3.0] Was I special?  [u.1:3.0] You were.  [u.2:3.1] But only as special as any other.  [u.1:3.1] You are all special.  [u.2:3.2] Seems to contradict the word donï¿½t  it.  [u.1:4.5] I will not leave you.  [u.2:4.6] I am leaving you.  [u.1:4.6] Without me, your journey ahead  will be more than any one Guardian can  handle.  [u.2:4.7] Thatï¿½s the point. Itï¿½s been sometime  since you saw me as worthy of walking  among those I once called brother and  sister. Yet... anymore, I feel as though I am  worthy of so much more.  [u.1:4.7] Without me... You will die.  [u.2:4.8] Someday. Wonï¿½t be the first time.  [silence]  [u.2:4.9] Consider this my last good deed. I  am releasing you of the burden of my  deeds, both done and yet to come.  [u.1:4.8] I will not abandon you.  [u.2:5.0] You will. Or I will carve the Light  from your shell and leave the carcass of my  first and last friend in the dirt of this dull, red  world for no one to find.  [u.1:4.9] Then Iï¿½ve failed you, completely.  [u.2:5.1] Not me. Maybe the man I was.  [u.1:5.0] He is truly dead.  [u.2:5.2] I believe so.  [u.1:5.1] Belief is not fact.  [u.2:5.3] Semantics I no longer have the  patience for.  [silence]  [u.2:5.4] When you speak of me, use my  proper name. Tell them of the man that  stands before you, not the ghost of the hero  I once was.  [u.1:5.2] You will always be [REDACTED] to  me.  [u.2:5.5] If you cannot let that man go, you  will forever taint his legacy. All the good I  have ever done will be washed away in the  fire of who I have become.  [u.1:5.3] If you care, there is still some  promise within you.  [u.1:3.2] Not in my estimation.  [u.2:3.3] If weï¿½re all special, are any of us  special?  [u.1:3.3] Is that what you want? To be  special?  [u.2:3.4] Heh.  [u.1:3.4] You dismiss, but itï¿½s a very serious  question. Is that all youï¿½re after? Is all of the  death worth that badge?  [u.2:3.5] Am I not already more than the rest?  [u.1:3.5] Looking at you here, now. The  smoke, ash and bone at your feet mark you as  so much less.  [u.2:3.6] Maybe. And yet here you are.  [u.1:3.6] Meaning?  [u.2:3.7] You have been at my side every step  of the way.  [u.1:3.7] Where else would I be?  [u.2:3.8] Yet you disagree so thoroughly with  my change in perspective.  [u.1:3.8] If only the change was simply one of  perspective. Your ï¿½evolutionï¿½ was no choice.  This is not you having come to an  understanding after careful considered  thought. This is corruption.  [u.2:3.9] The shadows?  [u.1:3.9] The Darkness.  [u.2:4.0] Maybe so.  [u.1:4.0] There is no maybe here.  [u.2:4.1] And you think you can save me?  [u.1:4.1] I rekindled your Light, it falls first to  me to aid in its survival.  [silence]  [u.2:4.2] I tire of it.  [u.1:4.2] You must try...  [u.2:4.3] I tire of you.  [u.1:4.3] [REDACTED]...  [u.2:4.4] That is no longer my name.  [u.1:4.4] I will not speak the other.  [u.2:4.5] It doesnï¿½t matter. This is where we  part ways.    165  [u.2:0.4] I am that which will cleanse.  [u.1:0.5] You are a monster.  [u.2:0.5] Heh. An old friend once saw me  as the same. He was right, and, had we  met earlier, so too would you be.  [u.1:0.6] Youï¿½d dare defend yourself ï¿½ all  youï¿½ve done ï¿½ as anything but monstrous?  [u.2:0.6] No more than a hurricane.  [u.1:0.7] Then youï¿½re a force of nature?  [u.2:0.7] I am all that is right. You may not  see it ï¿½ for lack of looking, or blind  ignorance ï¿½ but I am all that is good.  [u.1:0.8] Youï¿½ve just murdered a good man.  [u.2:0.8] He shot first.  [u.1:0.9] Yet you stand.  [u.2:0.9] Guess he missed.  [u.1:1.0] He never misses.  [u.2:1.0] First time for everything.  [silence]  [u.2:1.1] His cannon? Nice piece of  hardware.  [u.2:1.2] Well-worn, but clean. Smooth  hammer.  [u.1:1.1] It was his prize.  [u.2:1.3] Guess he put too much faith in the  wrong steel.  [u.1:1.2] Is that where your faith lies, in  steel?  [u.2:1.4] Not for some time. My steel is  only an extension. My faith is in the  shadow.  [u.1:1.3] Then my Light is an affront to all  you are. I am your truest enemy.  [u.2:1.5] One of many.  [u.1:1.4] Would you end me?  [u.2:1.6] Not you. Not now.  [u.1:1.5] The shadow knows mercy.  [u.2:1.7] The shadow knows no such thing.  [u.1:1.6] Then what?  [u.2:1.8] The other.  [u.1:1.7] What other?  [u.2:5.6] If I am being honest, I care only to  give hope to the frightened, huddled masses  so that when I come upon them they will have  more to lose. Their pain will be greater. Their  screams more pure.  [u.1:5.4] You...  [u.2:5.7] Nothing dies like hope. I cherish it.  [u.1:5.5] Youï¿½re a monster.  [u.2:5.8] Finally, you see the truth.  [u.1:5.6] [REDACTED] is truly dead.  [u.2:5.9] So Iï¿½ve said. Long live Dredgen Yor.  [u.1:5.7] This is farewell, but you can only run  from your sins so far. In the end, you will die  alone.  [u.2:6.0] Maybe so. But I gotta tell ya... I tend  to like my odds.  [u.1:5.8] Your tainted ï¿½Roseï¿½ will not always  save you.  [u.2:6.1] Old friend... It already has.

[u.2:1.9] The dead manï¿½s charge.  [u.1:1.8] The boy?  [u.1:1.9] Youï¿½d end him as well?  [u.2:2.0] If it comes to that... Weï¿½ll see.  [u.1:2.0] I wonï¿½t let you have the child.  [u.2:2.1] Been long enough now, think maybe  heï¿½s a man.  [u.1:2.1] You cannot have him.  [u.2:2.2] Not yet.  [u.1:2.2] I wonï¿½t let you.  [u.2:2.3] That you could stop me is an  amusing thought.  [silence]  [u.2:2.4] Here.  [silence]  [u.2:2.5] Take it.  [u.1:2.3] Why?  [u.2:2.6] Give the apprentice his masterï¿½s  ï¿½sword.ï¿½ It is a gift.  [u.1:2.4] You cannot have him.  [u.2:2.7] You fear for his Light?  [u.1:2.5] He...  [u.2:2.8] ...is special.  [u.1:2.6] Yes.  [u.2:2.9] I am aware.  [u.1:2.7] Youï¿½re trying to tempt him. Youï¿½re  feeding his anger.  [u.2:3.0] The gun is a memento, nothing  more.  [u.1:2.8] You claim to be a vessel, a hollow  shell where once a man stood, but that is just  a lie. The man is still in you.  [u.2:3.1] There is no man here, I am now,  and for the rest of time, only Dredgen Yor.  [u.1:2.9] ï¿½The Eternal Abyss?ï¿½  [u.2:3.2] So, not all the forgotten languages  are dead.

To spur him on and fuel his rage. There is  intent there. The actions of a man, monstrous,  mad or otherwise... you are nothing more.  [u.2:3.4] And what value does your  conclusion bring, flawed as it may be?  [u.1:3.2] That a hurricane can only be  weathered, not stopped. Not redirected. A  force of nature is uncaring and without intent,  but a man...  [u.2:3.5] Yes?  [u.1:3.3] A man is none of those things.  [silence]  [u.1:3.4] A man can be killed.

Of course, some might  say that time has come again.   The Last Word  T H E L A S T W O R D  I'm writing this from memory - some mine, but not all. The facts won't  sync with the reality, but they'll be close, and there's no one to say  otherwise, so for all intents and purposes, this will be the history of a  settlement we called Palamon and the horrors that followed an all too  brief peace.  I remember home, and stories of a paradise we'd all get to see some  day - of a City, "shining even in the night." Palamon didn't shine, but it  was sanctuary, of a sort.  We'd settled in the heart of a range that stretched the horizon.  Wooded mountains that shot with purpose toward the sky. Winters  were harsh, but the trees and peaks hid us from the world. We talked  about moving on, sometimes, striking out for the City. But it was just a  longing.    170  Drifters came and went. On occasion they would stay, but rarely. We  had no real government, but there was rule of law. Basic tenets  agreed upon by all and eventually overseen by Magistrate Loken.  And there you have it...no government, until there was. I was young,  so I barely understood. I remember Loken as a hardworking man who  just became broken. Mostly I think he was sad. Sad and frightened.  As his fingers tightened on Palamon, people left. Those who stayed  saw our days became grey. Loken's protection - from the Fallen, from  ourselves - became dictatorial.  Looking back, I think maybe Loken had just lost too much - of himself,  his family. But everyone lost something. And some of us had nothing  to begin with. My only memory of my parents is a haze, like a  daydream, and a small light, like the spark of their souls. It's not  anything I dwell on. They left me early, taken by Dregs.  Palamon raised me from there. The family I call my own - called my  own - cared for me as if I was their natural born son. And life was  good. Being the only life I knew, my judgment is skewed, and it  wasn't easy - pocked by loss as it was - but I would call it good.  Until, of course, it wasn't.  Until two men entered my world. One a light. The other the darkest  shadow I would ever know.   Ghost Fragment: The Last Word  The man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, my third father and  quite possibly my closest friend, came to Palamon from the south.  I was just a boy, but I'll never forget his silhouette on the empty trail as  he made his slow walk into town.  I'd never seen anything like him. Maybe none of us had. He'd said he  was only passing through, and I believed him - still do, but life can get  in the way of intent, and often does.  I can picture that day with near perfect clarity. Of all the details  though - every nuance, every moment - the memory that sticks in my  mind is the iron on Jaren's hip. A cannon that looked both pristine and  lived in. Like a relic of every battle he'd ever fought, hung low at his  waist - a trophy and a warning.  This man was dangerous, but there was a light about him - a pureness  to his weight - that seemed to hint that his ire was something earned,  not carelessly given.  I'd been the first to see him as he approached, but soon most of  Palamon had turned out to greet him. My father held me back as  everyone stood in silence.  Jaren didn't make a sound behind his sleek racer's helmet. He looked  just like the heroes in the stories, and to this day I'm not sure one way  or the other if the silence between the town's people and the  adventurer was born of fear or respect. I like to think the latter, but  any truth I try to place on the moment would be of my own making.  As we waited for Magistrate Loken to arrive and make an official  greeting, my patience got the best of me. I shook free of my father's  heavy hand and made the short sprint across the court, stopping a  few paces from where this new curiosity stood - a man unlike any  other.  I stared up at him and he lowered his attention to me, his eyes hidden  behind the thick tinted visor of his headgear. My sight quickly fell to  his sidearm. I was transfixed by it. I imagined all the places that  weapon had been. All of the wonders it had seen. The horrors it had  endured. My imagination darted from one heroic act to the next.  I barely registered when he began to kneel, holding out the iron as if  an offering. But my eyes locked onto the piece, mesmerized.  I recall turning back to my father and seeing the looks on the faces of  everyone I knew. There was worry there - my father slowly shaking his  head as if pleading with me to ignore the gift.  I turned back to the man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, the  finest Hunter this system may ever know and one of the greatest  Guardians to ever defend the Traveler's Light...    171  And I took the weapon in my hand. Carefully.  Gently.  Not to use. But to observe. To imagine. To feel  its weight and know its truth.  That was the first time I held "Last Word," but,  unfortunately, not the last.   Ghost Fragment: The Last Word 2  It was the fourth night of the seventh moon.  Nine rises since any sign.  Trail wasn't cold, but lukewarm would've been  an exaggeration.  Jaren had us hold by a ravine.  The heavy wood along the cliffs' edge caught  the wind, holding back the cold and the rush  of water muffled our conversation.  We'd seen dual Skiffs hanging low as they cut  through the valley.  Wasn't known Fallen territory, but anymore  that's a dangerous assumption.  There were six of us then.  Three less than two moons prior, but still, one  more than when we'd first turned our backs to  Palamon's ash.  We took a rotation for watch during the night.  Movement was kept to a minimum and  communication was down to hand signals  and simple gestures.  Jaren never wavered though. Not once.  At least not to any noticeable degree.  It was his drive, his conviction, that kept us  going.  Andï¿½it's hard to think onï¿½but if I'm honest, it  was his death that rekindled my own fire. A  fire that was all but exhausted on that cold  night.  He seemed confident we were close.  But more than confidentï¿½sure. He seemed  sure.  No one else felt itï¿½our own confidence, and  any enthusiasm we'd had was set to wither  soon as Brevin, Trenn and Mel were gunned  We could hold our own in a fight, but only the  dead went looking for oneï¿½a hard truth that  cut in direct opposition to our reasons for  being so far from anything resembling  civilization, much less our safety.  The Skiffs had spooked Kressler and Nada,  and, in truth, me as well. But, looking back, I  think we were all just grasping for any good  reason to turn back.  Not because we wouldï¿½turn backï¿½but  because it seemed to be our only real hope,  and I think we all knew it.  Forward. Where we were headedï¿½into the  unknown. And following the footsteps we  were. It all just started to feel like a neverending  dead end after a while.     172  down.  The Ghostï¿½Jaren's Ghostï¿½never said a word  to any of us. Just hung there. Always alert.  Always judging. Not us, per se, but the  moment. Any moment.  I never got the sense it thought of us as lesser.  More that it was guarded, wary.  We knew it could speak. We'd overheard them  a few times. Just brief words, and no one ever  pressed the subject.  From time to time I caught its gaze lingering on  me, but always assumed the attention was a  result of the bond Jaren and I had. He was a  father to me. At the time I didn't know why he'd  singled me out as someone to care for.  Someone to protect. After all the loss, I  We crouched low and quiet. Listening.  Hoping.  Jaren was gone. Off on his own.  Maybe we were closer than we'd allowed  ourselves to believe.  Too close.  He'd gone to face death alone.  I couldn't admit itï¿½not at the timeï¿½but he  thought he was protecting us.  After such a long roadï¿½years on its heels, a  trail littered with suffering and fireï¿½maybe  he just couldn't take the thought of anymore  dead "kids," as he called us.  The echoes faded and we all held still. No  way to track the direction. No sense in  rushing blind.  What was done was done.  The cadence of the shots fired told a story  none of us cared to hear.  "Last Word" it hadn't been. And somewhere  in the world, close enough for us to bear  absent witness but far enough to be a  dream, Jaren Ward lay dead or dying. And  there was nothing to be done.  Hours passed. An eternity.  We held our spot, but as the sun rose the  others began to fade back into the world.  Without Jaren there was nothing holding us  together. No driving force. Vengeance had  welcomed it, but looking backï¿½taking in the  arm's length at which he kept the othersï¿½I  guess I should've known, or at least suspected  there was more to it.  We all woke that night, closer to morning than  the previous day.  A crack of gunfire split through the wood. Then  more.  Far off, but near enough to pump the blood.  A familiar ring. "Last Word." Jaren's sidearm.  His best friend.  Then another. A single shot, an unmistakable  echo calling through the night. Hushed, cutting.  One shot, dark and infernal. Followed by  silence.    173  grown stale as a motivator. Fear and a longing  to see more suns rise drove a wedge between  duty and desire.  By midday I was alone. I couldn't leave.  Wouldn't.  Either I would find Jaren and set him at ease,  or the other would find me and that would be a  fitting end.  Death marching on.  But then, a motion. Quick and darting. My  muscles tensed and my hand shot to the grip of  my leadslinger.  Then a confirmation of the horrible truth I had  already accepted, as Jaren's Ghost came to a  halt a few paces in front of me.  I exhaled and slumped forward. Still standing,  but broken.  The tiny Light looked me over with a curious tilt  to its axis, then shot a beam of light over my  body. Scanning me as it had done the very  first time we met.  I looked up. Staring into its singular glowing  eye.  And it spoke...   Ghost Fragment:The Last Word 3  Then.  Palamon was ash.  I was only a boy ï¿½ my face caked in soot, snot  and sorrow.  As the silhouette approached, fear held tight.  The dark figure towered over me. Looking  into me ï¿½ through me.  He smiled. My knees weak. All lost.  Then, he turned and walked away.  Leaving ruin and a heartbroken, terrified boy  in his wake without a second glance.  Iï¿½ve been chasing that strangerï¿½s shadow  ever since.  Now.  We stood silent, the sun high. Seconds  passed, feeling more like hours.  He looked different. He seemed, now, to be  weightless ï¿½ effortless in an existence that  would crush a man burdened by conscience.  My gaze remained locked as I felt a heat  rising inside of me. The other spoke...  ï¿½Been awhile.ï¿½  I gave no reply.  ï¿½The gunslingerï¿½s sword... his cannon. That  was a gift.ï¿½  My silence held as my thumb caressed the  perfectly worn hammer at my hip.  ï¿½An offering from me... to you.ï¿½  The heat grew. Centered in my chest.  Iï¿½d assumed Jaren, my friend, our Guardian,  the savior of Palamon, would always protect  us ï¿½ could always save us...  But I was a fool.  Jaren, and the others, only a handful, but still  our best hunters, our hardest hearts, had left  three suns prior. Tracking Fallen, after the  bandits had caused a stir.  The stranger ï¿½ the other ï¿½ arrived the  following day.  He rarely spoke. Took a room. Took our  hospitality.  I was intrigued by him, as I was Jaren when  heï¿½d first arrived.  But the stranger was cold. Distant. Damaged,  I thought.  But I wasnï¿½t afraid. Not yet.  Only a child, I knew the monsters of our world  to walk like men, but they were not. They  were something alien. Four-armed and  savage.  The stranger was polite, but solemn.  I took him for a sad, broken man, and he  was. Though, at the time, I didnï¿½t understand  how that could make one dangerous.  As with Jaren, father made an effort to keep  me away from the stranger.  It wouldnï¿½t matter.    174  I felt like a coward the day Jaren Ward died  and for many cycles after.  But here, I felt only the fire of my Light.  The other probed...  ï¿½Nothing to say?ï¿½  He let the words hang.  ï¿½Iï¿½ve been waiting for you. For this day.ï¿½  His attempt at conversation felt mundane when  judged against all that had come before.  ï¿½Many times I thought youï¿½d faltered. Given  up...ï¿½  All Iï¿½d lost, all whoï¿½d suffered, flashed rapid  through my mind, intercut with a dark silhouette  walking toward a frightened, weak, coward of  a boy.  The fire burned in me.  The other continued...  ï¿½But here you are. This is truly an end...ï¿½  As his tongue slipped between syllables my  gun hand moved as if of its own will.  Reflex and purpose merged with anger, clarity  and an overwhelming need for just that... an  end.  In step with my motion, the fire within burst into  focus ï¿½ through my shoulder, down my arm ï¿½  as my finger closed on the trigger of my third  TYPE: Transcript.  DESCRIPTION: Conversation.

He never raised his  cursed Thorn ï¿½ the jagged gun with the  festering sickness.  I looked down at the dead man who had  caused so much death.  My shooter still embraced by the dancing  flames of my Light. A sadness came over me.  I thought back to my earliest days. Of  Palamon. Of Jaren.  Leveling my cannon at the dead manï¿½s helm, I  paid one final tribute to my mentor, my savior,  my father and my friend...  ï¿½Yours...

Ghost Fragment: The Last Word 4    4 . 2 U S I N G F I N E S S E     176  Shotguns  There are few weapons that offer the comfort and familiarity of a  shotgun. Built for close quarters combat, they provide immediate,  violent conflict resolution.   Shotguns  Universal Remote  To the untrained eye this beast is a junker. To the  trained eye, however, this junker...is a beast.  It took great care, and an incredible feat of fine-tuning,  to craft a weapon that packs a close-quarters punch,  yet has the range of a precision rifle. Universal Remote  is that weapon.   Universal Remote  Invective  "I tried to talk them down. They made a grab for my Ghost. After that it was  a short conversation." - Ikora Rey  Invective was Ikora Rey's weapon of choice during her younger, more  rebellious days. An ideal fallback for situations that can't be solved by wit,  quick talk, or pure intimidation, this modified shotgun uses a self-replicating  magazine to keep its owner well-stocked for any and all trouble that waits  beyond the City.   Invective    177  Lord of Wolves  "By this right alone do I rule."  Jolyon was a Crow. He'd seen much. More than most. He held the enemy's greatest  weapon. Remembered its burn. Then began tinkering. He liked things. Liked how  they worked. Found happiness in finding new avenues through which a thing could  function. Not to alter the purpose, but simply to refine it.  The weapon delivered impact with incredible force spread over a range to increase  its area of influence. But what if that force was brought to focus in a directed burst.  A seasoned marksman with a steady, strong hand could deliver a burn that served  less to herd, more to punish.  The feral ones deserved nothing less. The Wolves would have a new master. And  that master was fire.   Lord of Wolves  The Chaperone  ï¿½My mother had a shotgun we called the Chaperone. Kept us alive out there,  before we got to the City.ï¿½ -Amanda Holliday  Amanda Holliday was born on the road, when the City was nothing more than a  whispered prayer. Their only protection was the weapons they could scavenge,  build or modify. Weapons like her mother's two-barrel shotgun, with its black and  gold filigree far too fine for the world around it. They called it the Chaperone.  That Chaperone lies in a shallow grave with its last owner, but Amanda recalls  every detail of its design. And via a partnership with the gunsmiths of Tex  Mechanica, she's brought the Chaperone back to life. Though the new weapon is  much more powerful than the cantankerous relic the Hollidays used on the road, it  bears the appearance, and the name, of the Chaperone that saw the one surviving  Holliday safely to the Last City.   The Chaperone    178  The 4th Horseman  "By this right alone do I rule."  Jolyon was a Crow. He'd seen much. More than most. He held the enemy's greatest  weapon. Remembered its burn. Then began tinkering. He liked things. Liked how they  worked. Found happiness in finding new avenues through which a thing could  function. Not to alter the purpose, but simply to refine it.  The weapon delivered impact with incredible force spread over a range to increase  its area of influence. But what if that force was brought to focus in a directed burst. A  seasoned marksman with a steady, strong hand could deliver a burn that served less  to herd, more to punish.  The feral ones deserved nothing less. The Wolves would have a new master. And that  master was fire.   The 4th Horseman  Fusion Rifles  Advancements in directed energy disbursement, gained through the  discovery of Golden Age research, led to the creation of stable, field-ready  energy-based weaponry. The first implementation of this technology comes in  the form of the Fusion Rifle. Users must hold the trigger down for a few  moments to charge the weapon before firing.   Fusion Rifles    179  Pocket Infinity  You cannot shake the feeling that this is less a weapon than a doorway.  Fireteam Tuyet died in the Ishtar Sink, hunting the secrets of the Vex. They must have  come too close to something precious, for the Vex descended on them with their typical  inscrutable, thorough violence.  But their sacrifice was not in vain. The data they gathered helped forge the Pocket  Infinity. Properly modified, the weapon should be capable of devastating output on just a  single charge cycle.  The Infinity's mechanisms have proven difficult, if not impossible, to replicate en masse. It  is conceivable that the weapon draws its energy from the Vex networks...an ominous  possibility. So be wary with it.   Pocket Infinity  Queenbreaker's Bow  "A reminder that while so few 'Breakers remain, Her Majesty still stands."  "Queenbreaker" was the label given to the Fallen who first rose to betray the Queen.  Their coordinated attempt on Her Grace's life was quick and violent. Most of the  Queenbreakers were eliminated, their line rifles taken as trophies. Some remain atlarge.  Known as Queenbreakers' Bows, the very weapons once used in an effort to  assassinate the Queen of the Reef are now prized possessions for Guardiansï¿½not only  for their storied history, but for the chance to get their hands on fully functional Fallen  weaponry.   Queenbreaker's Bow    180  Vex Mythoclast  ...a causal loop within the weapon's mechanism, suggesting that the firing process  somehow binds space and time into...  Some legends live forever. Others are overwritten - reshaped by the sheer will of those  who believe that any ordeal can be conquered, any foe vanquished, any god cast down.  The Mythoclast is a Vex instrument from some far-flung corner of time and space,  mysteriously fit for human hands. Its origins, mechanism of action, and ultimate purpose  remain unknown. Perhaps it will reveal itself to you, in time...   Vex Mythoclast  Telesto  Vestiges of the Queen's Harbingers yet linger among Saturn's moons.

Sharp reflexes keep you alive on the frontier - but no matter how fast you are, a fusion  rifle can only charge so quickly. Enter the Plan C.

Plan C    182  Sniper Rifles  The dangers present beyond the City's walls cannot always be  met head-on. The accuracy and power of the Sniper Rifle offers  the best option for precise ranged attacks. Caliber and make  differ, but a good sniper can always remove key threats.   Sniper Rifles  Herafter  ï¿½Huddled at the mountain's base, we had no choice  but to beat our ploughshares into swords once more.ï¿½  Once, we had peace.  This isn't a story about peace.

Patience and Time    183  Icebreaker  Please replace these components if use causes fatal damage: HEAT SINK.  MAGAZINE. OPERATOR  The Ice Breaker series was a clandestine project developed by the Vanguard in  conjunction with various City weapons foundries. Meant as an exploration of Golden  Age weapon technology, the project was scrapped after only a single weapon  reached the testing phase.  The prototypes for the project's lone weapon are considered dangerous and unfit for  field duty by the Vanguard. This hasn't stopped daring Guardians from seeking out  the Ice Breakers - death, after all, is an occupational hazard.   Icebreaker  Zen Meteor  ï¿½Complete awareness, complete focus. A mind sharpened by diligence to a single  deadly point.ï¿½ - From the writings of Taeko-3, Praxic Deconstructionist  Exo have always known that a machine is capable of bridging the gap between the  physical and the numinous. It is from that knowledge, and my collaboration with two  Guardians ï¿½ Hunter Uzoma Vale and the Warlock they call The Stoic ï¿½ that the Zen  Meteor was born.  This groundbreaking weapon uses electroencephalography to draw energy from the  wielder's neural activity. It can even, if a certain threshold is met, convert that energy into  matter to be used as concussive ammunition.  Or, to be more precise ï¿½ the more focused the wielder's mind, the more powerful the  weapon.   Zen Meteor    184  Black Spindle  ï¿½Your only existence shall be that which I weave for you out of sorrow and woe.ï¿½  The followers of Crota swing Hammers,  Sing death-songs:  Fatal.  Final.  Absolute.  Ir Halak and Ir Anï¿½k laugh at Crota.  Finality is a child's plaything,  Fit for one such as Crota,  They say.  No Hammer for the Unraveler and the Weaver,  But a Spindle, wound with woe.  For their foes,  No end of suffering.   Black Spindle  No Land Beyond  Every hit blazes the path to our reclamation.  Rumors of this weapon's existence sent many a Guardian clawing through the corners of  Old Russia, seeking its legend. Some believe its origins predate the Golden Age and  served to liberate the old Earth nation from a terrible cycle of war.  Others believe it a Golden Age relic built to honor the sniper and their artful approach to  battleï¿½to lean on the sole power of the long rifle, nest where the enemy cannot see, trust  in the power of calm and know there is nowhere to fall back to.   No Land Beyond    185  Sidearms  The Sidearms class is made up of lightweight pistols designed for  ease of handling and quick-firing. Its antiquated triggering system  and engineering make it rare within City limits. As it's long been  a staple of the Awoken Royal Guard, perhaps this newly forged  alliance between the Reef and the City will see the Sidearm  become commonplace within Guardian arsenals.   Sidearms  Dreg's Promise  "I am a marvel with ten thousand arms."  There is a story, old as time, of he who could catch the stars. Unnamed and eternal, the  star-catcher would lead the Fallen, rising from the lowest station to the highest exalted  peaks. It is a fairy tale allowed to persist by the four-armed to keep the docked hopeful,  placatedï¿½even the low may one day ascend.  Myth, fairy tale or a prophecy of what will be, it's best to not take chances. After all, one  can't reach across the black to claim dominion over ten thousand stars with ten thousand  arms if they die here and now with only two.   Dreg's Promise  Trespasser  ï¿½You are not welcome.ï¿½ ï¿½Unknown  ï¿½I beg to differ.ï¿½ ï¿½Shiro-4  Trespasser is Shiro-4ï¿½s personal sidearm, kit-bashed over  the uncounted cycles Shiro-4 spent braving the wilds  beyond the City. This light, quick-fire shooter has ended  more conversations than it has started. And will end  many more before the last war is won.   Trespasser    186  Vestian Dynasty  "A Reef scout hunts for yearsï¿½fighting piracy and ancient trapsï¿½to crack one cache and claim  the weapons within."  Imagine: you live in the largest territory in the system. A huge torus of habitable, explorable  space. But there's a catch. That huge space is made up of millions and millions of nooks and  crannies. Asteroids. Crumbling derelicts. Debris from dozens of wars. It's a place where you  could go for thousandsï¿½millionsï¿½of miles without ever seeing another friendly face, and yet  never once be able to stretch your legs.  Now imagine: you're spelunking across an asteroid, or crawling through a half-collapsed ship  that could be hundreds of years old. You won't see enemies coming, not in a tight corner like  that. Won't hear 'em or smell 'em either, not in the void. But then you move, or they move, and  there you both are.  Rifles, shotguns, they aren't gonna cut it. You don't have room to heft a barrel of that length.  Don't have the arm room to throw a knife or a grenade either. But what you do have is a  sidearm at your hip. Small enough for a fast draw, strong enough to save your life.  That's why the Queen sends out every last Corsair with a Vestian Dynasty sidearm at our hips.  And Vestian Dynasty is what gets us home again too.   Vestian Dynasty    4.3  BRUTE  FORCE     188  Rocket Launchers  Rocket Launchers have a limited, devastating payload that  provides an excellent countermeasure to heavily-armored ground  forces and combat vehicles. There is no better battlefield  equalizer. Skilled users often aim for the ground beneath nimble  targets.   Rocket Launchers  Gjallarhorn  "If there is beauty in destruction, why not also in its  delivery?"- Feizel Crux  The Gjallarhorn shoulder-mounted rocket system was  forged from the armor of Guardians who fell at the  Twilight Gap. Gifted to the survivors of that terrible  battle, the Gjallarhorn is seen as a symbol of honor  and survival.   Gjallarhorn  Dragon's Breath  Burn the world. Burn it all.  From the labs of Feizel Crux and Victor Lomar comes another shoulder  assault offering built to match the incendiary fury of a legendary beast ï¿½ or  at least classic depictions of it.  Carrying three rockets, each equipped with Solar Flare detonators, its  power is believed to far outmatch those of the mythical flying monster, but  we're still hoping an actual showdown between the two will put an end to  that argument.   Dragon's Breath    189  Truth  "...is where you seek it." - Lomar  Truth is a cutting-edge rocket launcher developed by Crux/Lomar. Smart warheads calculate  and understand the user's intent upon firing.  There may have been a time when warfare in the solar system was dominated by lightningquick  AI weapons and swarms of autonomous munitions. If so, that time is past. The  Traveler's Light has given rise to an age of heroes with undreamt power. But there is still a  place for cleverly designed machines - and as the City's foundries reclaim the technical  prowess of the Golden Age, our machines will become cleverer still.   Truth  Machine Guns  The Machine Gun is an unapologetic weapon  of war. Its ability to carry and process large  quantities of high-caliber ammunition allows for  sustained, focused attacks, making them ideal  for the suppression and/or annihilation of  hostile forces.   Machine Guns  Thunderlord  "They rest quiet on fields afar...for this is no ending, but the eye." - Hymn of the Thunderlord  Customized with an experimental induction core, the Thunderlord is a heavy machine gun  built for the delivery of sustained punishment.  The weapon's history and mechanism are both shrouded in ritualistic awe. Each round fired  is another word in the legend - and the Guardians who bear the Thunderlord will be  immortalized in song.   Thunderlord    190  Abbadon  "I am one with the flame. The conflagration reborn. I am your funeral pyre." Anthem  of the Abbadon  A variant of the Thunderlord outfitted with a prototype fusion modulation device, the  Abbadon is built for rapid domination of the enemy.  Its mechanism is a delicate balance of barely-contained power and brute force. Every  round it fires contains the potency of a sun.   Abbadon  Nova Mortis  "From the space between I come. Fragments of stars  burn in my footsteps. In my hands I hold Death." Song  of the Nova Mortis  Before he died on the Moon, the Titan who wielded the  first Thunderlord created two variants of the mighty  weapon. Nova Mortis harnesses the power of the Void.  Notes found on the original schematic for Nova Mortis  reveal its creator worried the weapon was as  dangerous to its wielder as it was to those in its sights.   Nova Mortis  Nemesis Star  What is the answer, when the question is extinction?  Who, or what, is the weapons foundry known as Nadir? Where did it come from?  And is the foundryï¿½s name a commentary on its own quality, or that of its rivals? An  expression of fatalism? An inside joke?  Do these questions matter next to a weapon as powerful as the Nemesis Star?   Nemesis Star    191 Super Good Advice  This weapon is full of it.  This machine gun's incredible mechanism hints at the wonders of Golden Age technology. Smart  rounds report their trajectories to the weapon, and a micro-transmat protocol recalls missed shots  directly to the magazine.  Engineers decry the idea that all smart systems spontaneously develop personalities and  awareness...but it seems undeniable that Super Good Advice manifests personality, memory, and a  certain sass. The truth may lie in the weapon's connection to the legendary Hunter Pahanin, who  witnessed the fall of Kabr and became terrified of traveling alone.   Super Good Advice  Swords  ï¿½There is no grace in their making, but we can change that.ï¿½ -Lord Shaxx  History might come to call it the Great Hive War, but others will remember it  as the day the swords came to the City. Luckily Lord Shaxxï¿½s skills and  research in all matters of swordplay will help ease this new age of weaponry  into the Guardian fold.   Swords    192  The Young Wolf's Howl  "To the first of the new Iron Lords." ï¿½Lord Saladin  This is more than a weapon.  Forged by Lord Saladin within the hallowed halls of the Iron Temple, this sword was intended for  you, and none other.  When you wield it, its burning flames represent the bright light of your valor ï¿½ and the allconsuming  sacrifice that you have promised to make, should you be called to it.  Take up this blade, and teach your enemies to fear the Young Wolfï¿½s Howl.  The Young Wolf's Howl  Dark Drinker  Draw close now. Closer. Yes. Let me tell you why you should not fear Willbreaker, the sword of  Oryx.  Firstly: Its blade is not dulled by age. Each death it trades for life hones its edge, gives it  weight and gravitas and insistence within the vortex of its own totality.  Nextly: Willbreaker transcends liminality. Willbreaker demands a subjugation more diffuse  than the simple snick and smash of a physical brink. It does not have to touch you to wound  you.  And lastlyï¿½and this is critical: To be taken in Willbreaker's grasp is to know true bliss; that is,  to be simplified; that is, to be reduced to one's most basic level, shedding all higher-order  thoughts of fear or duty or selfishness; that is, to feel only pain. Now do you see? Now do you  understand what you've done?   Dark Drinker    193  Bolt Caster  Excerpt of a missive from Lord Shaxx to the Tower Cryptarchy  ...there must be a way to imbue it with Light. That is Ikora's theory. How glad I would be  of her help, but her eyes are occupied with other trials.  Perhaps if I folded another substance into the bladeï¿½one that is forged in Lightï¿½it might  imprint upon the malleable Hadium, share its attributes. But what substance? Ghosts are  out of the question. Spinmetal is in the blade already, but its Arc was too diffuse to move  the Hadium. Is there a way to refine Spinmetal, distil it to its core elements?  I have little gift for the science of this, but my resolve will not be thwarted. Maybe the  Cryptarchs can advise.   Bolt Caster  Raze Lighter  ï¿½Next order of business... the growing City foundriesï¿½ï¿½  [Bang]  ï¿½What madness is this!ï¿½  ï¿½Lord Shaxx! The Consensus did notï¿½ï¿½  ï¿½We barely eked out victory at Burning Lake.

Lysander'scry    197  Glimmer  The programmable matter called 'Glimmer' serves as one of the City's basic currencies.  With the right inputs and an energy source, Glimmer can be transmuted into nearly  anything. This makes it precious to the City's industries and artisans. That value, in turn,  makes Glimmer a useful means of exchange - especially with those who venture beyond  the City's walls.  Glimmer passes through an economic life cycle. New Glimmer comes from reclaimed  Golden Age caches and technology - whether a tiny mechanism or an underground  lode seeded by ancient machines. This expansion of the Glimmer supply drives down  the value of Glimmer. But Glimmer is also constantly used by the City's industry, which  converts it into necessary components and materials. This sink helps keep Glimmer  scarce, and therefore valuable.  Between this inflow and outflow lies the pool of liquidity - Glimmer used as trade  currency. Master Rahool in the Tower, for example, sells recovered matter engrams in  exchange for Glimmer, since he knows he can use Glimmer to acquire new engrams  and keep them flowing to Guardians.  Newborn Guardians often complain that they should be issued high-quality gear for  free - are they not, after all, fighting for the future of the City? Unfortunately, this gear  requires resources to manufacture. Guardians must bring in enough Glimmer and other  staples, like spinmetal and relic iron, to keep the engine of the City's economy turning.  If good times lead to a resource boom, that surplus may help mass-produce advanced  gear.   Glimmer  C U R R E N C I E S     198  Vanguard Marks  When a terrible threat rises, Guardians look to the Vanguard, the closest thing they  have to a command structure. These elite veterans coordinate the reports of roaming  Hunters, the analyses of cloistered Warlocks, and the instincts of grizzled Titans into a  single plan of action. And when Guardians fight as part of that plan, the Vanguard  rewards them.  Vanguard Marks are tokens of favor that earn a trusted Guardian access to the  Tower's armories. Listen carefully to the rumblings of Lord Shaxx, and you might come  to believe that this system was meant to keep vital warfighting supplies from being  wasted in the Crucible. Talk to Commander Zavala, and he will reassure you that the  Vanguard Mark system exists for one reason: to get the best equipment into the hands  of those who get the best results.  Guardians eager to win Vanguard Marks would do well to participate in Strike  missions organized by the Vanguard.   Vanguard Marks  Crucible Marks  The Crucible is a program of relentless live-fire training, hardening Guardians for battles  to come. Competition thrives on risk and reward, so Lord Shaxx has seen fit to dispense  Crucible Marks to those who excel.  Guardians with a name in the Crucible can spend these Marks on elite gear. Shaxx  considers it fitting that the best should earn the best. The City's factions, fond of using the  Crucible as an arena to advance their own interests, will also accept Crucible marks in  exchange for their equipment.  Guardians eager to win Crucible Marks should fight in the Crucible, with particular  attention to those challenges Lord Shaxx deems important.   Crucible Marks    199  Motes of Light  The Speaker has no interest in Glimmer, Marks, or the other currencies of  the Tower's military functions. But he happily accepts these Motes, points  of Light willed into being by an exercise of a mighty Guardian's power.  Some say they will one day become the souls of new Ghosts. Others  believe they feed the intricate machinery that the Speaker tends. Whatever  the case, the Speaker will happily reward donors with patterns and signs  from his collection - more out of gratitude than any mercantile impulse.   Motes of Light  Strange Coins  Each coin rings with a faint, sharp hush - as if it has touched the sounds  around it with the edge of silence.  These could buy incredible things, in the right hands. Whispers say the  faceless creature who sometimes comes to the Tower covets them above all  else.   Strange Coins    200  Upgrade Materials  As Guardians buy or salvage new equipment, they learn to tinker and improve. This work  requires Glimmer and other material.  Some can be recycled from unneeded gear. Titans favor plasteel, which can be found by  disassembling old equipment. Hunters unspool discarded armor into sapphire wire.  Warlocks extract hadronic essence from dismantled fieldweave robes. And any Guardian  with a sense for weaponry can disassemble old ordnance into weapon parts.  Other materials need to be scavenged on site, generally in the course of Patrols. The  Cosmodrome in Old Russia is rich with spinmetal, a fantastically light and strong composite  created by rogue colonies of Golden Age machinery that escaped storage. Solar coil  systems on the Moon still generate helium filaments. The baffling, possibly Vex-influenced  flora of Venus grow spirit blooms. And the surface of Mars offers deposits of ultra-dense  relic iron.  The most powerful Guardian equipment transcends ordinary science, entering the realm of  Golden Age secrets and the Traveler's power itself. This wargear demands Ascendant  Energy and Ascendant Shards - burning fragments of the universal fundament, earned  through mighty acts of heroism.   Upgrade Materials  Chroma  ï¿½It's not just about how you fight. It's about how you look.ï¿½ - Tess Everis  Eververse is proud to introduce: Chroma.  This Golden Age lighting technique was recently rediscovered by no other than Eververse's chief  creative officer Fenchurch Everis. Using multi-channel heat sinks to accentuate Guardian weapons  and armor, Chroma is a style for the fiercely, fearlessly fashionable.   Chroma    201  Eververse  ï¿½I like your style, Fenchurch. Have you ever considered selling any of these? No? Well, I think  the people need to see your work, Fen. I really do. Listen, I have an idea...ï¿½ - Tess Everis  Tess Everis is always on the lookout for new opportunities. So when she crossed paths with the  infamously eccentric artist, designer, explorer and Guardian who became known as Fenchurch  Everis, Tess knew an opportunity when she saw it.  He brings the creative flair: roving the planetary wastes, gathering rare antiquities, crafting  vibrantly new pieces, sharing new customs and techniques. She handles everything else, from  business to marketing to managing the often-wayward talent.  Tess brokers Fenchurch's unique finds and offerings to Guardians of the Tower under the  banner of the  "Eververse Trading Co." Dealing exclusively in a rare Awoken crypto-currency called "Silver",  Eververse is the first major merchant in the City that is unapologetically dedicated to style  above substance. In a society wracked by near-constant war, Tess believes beauty for beauty's  sake is a revolutionary idea.   Eververse  Silver Coins  ï¿½Old Neville here woke me in the Martian wastes. Utterly alone, with nothing but our witsï¿½  and a lone, silvered coin buried in the sand beside me. This very coin, in fact. What could it  signify? A mysterious message? A sign of royal birthright? A key to some ancient puzzle? For  all my many adventures, this answer yet eludes meï¿½ What's that?ï¿½ - Fenchurch Everis  Long before the Collapse, the Reef settlements used a currency commonly known as Silverï¿½  coins with engram-like qualities which could be digitally signed with an individual person's key.  Tess Everis, born in the City after her parents fled the Reef, counts among her most prized  possessions an old Silver coin that belonged to her Reefborn grandmother. As the Silver was  cryptographically unique, she was stunned to meet an Awoken Warlock named Fenchurch who  possessed around his neck a Silver coin of his own, signed with the exact same key as Tess's.  Like all Guardians, Fenchurch has no memories before the first time his Ghost resurrected him.  But their Silver coins' shared origin leads Tess and Fenchurch to suspect that they are related.  Fenchurch instantly took to thinking of Tess as a long-lost niece, even assuming her surname,  Everis. Tess loves the Silver that her new partnership with Fenchurch bringsï¿½ but, though she'd  never admit it, she secretly values her newfound family even more.   Silver Coins    5.0  PROVING  GROUNDS  205       207  The Crucible  "You wanna live? You're gonna have to prove it." - Lord Shaxx,  Crucible Handler and veteran of the Twilight Gap  The Crucible is a series of grueling challenges that pit Guardians  against one another in open combat. Crucible combat is live-fire,  with Ghosts standing by to save the dead.  Whether alone or with a Fireteam, Guardians enter the Crucible to  hone vital survival skills, build their own reputations, and win the  patronage of City factions. Most importantly, the Crucible allows  Guardians to train against formidable adversaries without fear of  disaster.   Crucible Introduction  5 . 1 C R U C I B L E A R E N A S  Sparrow Racing League  "Some of the best Guardians are racers. People like Marcus Ren  have made their legends on the track." - Amanda Holliday  Ever since the proliferation of the Sparrow, racing is a long-standing  tradition among Guardians, but only in recent years have the races  moved from an underground attraction to an organized sport.  Under the direction of the SRL, Redjacks and Guardians clear hostile  zones and mark the race courses. Residents of the Tower and the  City eagerly wait for news of the sport and follow the exploits of  their favorite racers.   Sparrow Racing League  "Very good! You haven't come close to beating any of my records,  but I applaud the effort." - Fenchurch Everis  The SRL is making a concerted effort to track race results. As a part  of this program, Eververse is offering rewards for skilled racers who  can provide proof of exceptional results on the circuit.   SRL Record Book    208  Burning Shrine  "They do not simply invade new worlds, they infect them - remaking them in their image, until  only Vex remain."  ARENA DESIGNATION: The Burning Shrine  LOCATION: Fields of Glass, Mercury  This clockwork impossibility is but one small conduit in a vast network, extending throughout the  dead planet's core.  The unknown energies and complex mechanics of the Shrine have been studied and mapped by  the curious, yet its purpose remains a mystery. The only truth that can be agreed upon is that the  structure is intimately tied to the past, and future, of one of our greatest enemies - the Vex.  The Shrine has been claimed as a battleground for the Crucible in an effort to familiarize  Guardians with both Vex architecture and the otherworldly energies that signal their presence.  Having a constant flow of combat-ready Guardians on hand should the Shrine ever achieve a  higher functionality is simply a strategic byproduct of the Crucible's presence.   The Burning Shrine  Shores of Time  "All power is humbled when weighed against the eternal tide."  ARENA DESIGNATION: Shores of Time  LOCATION: Maat Mons, Venus  The sulfur caves along the Shores of Time are now too unstable to be an effective base  of operations for the Vex, but they suit the purposes of the Crucible just fine.  The region, which also houses the remains of one of the Ishtar Collective's many  research stations, is a mix of geological chaos and the structured intent of ancient Vex  machinery. The contrast between jagged, boiling terrain and the measured purpose of  each Vex surface creates a unique battlefield - one where the planet itself seems to have  risen up in defiance of the Vex intrusion.   Shores of Time    209  Asylum  "There used to be life here. Now it's just overgrowth."  ARENA DESIGNATION: Asylum  LOCATION: Ishtar Sink, Venus  Before the Collapse, this would've been just another stop on the subway line between  Clovis Bray's Venus arcology headquarters and the Academy campus by the shore.  Now, it's a grim reminder of the lives, the dreams, and the progress we lost when the  Darkness came. For the Guardians of the Crucible, it's a place to sharpen their blades  in the shadow of the Vex, an enemy who knows no such sentimentality.   Asylum  Twilight Gap  "Here we fight, for the memory of those who stood. Here we die, for the glory of the  Light that never fades."  ARENA DESIGNATION: Twilight Gap  LOCATION: City Perimeter, Earth  Named for the City's greatest battle, this defensive battery once held the front line  against the combined might of the Fallen Houses. Overrun during the course of the  invasion, many Guardians lost their lives to hold the line.  That the Crucible now claims this hallowed ground is seen as a privilege - a rite of  passage, as new generations of Guardians stand and fight where the brave fell, heroes  rose, and legends were born.   Twilight Gap    210  The Rusted Lands  "The scars of our collapse mark the land. Reminders that all is fragile in the face of time."  ARENA DESIGNATION: The Rusted Lands  LOCATION: Eastern Flood Zone, Earth  "The Hive never leaves the Moon." This is dogma - a way to soothe frightened children and  reassure wary Guardians.  Not so long ago, a wandering Hunter and her Fireteam stumbled onto a feral community in the  Eastern Flood Zone. The gaunt survivors huddled in these bombed-out ruins spoke of a terrible  presence and begged for protection. No self-respecting Guardian could refuse.  As night fell, the Guardians found themselves the hunted - stalked through the ruins by shapes  of bone and shadow. The discovery of a Hive Seeder made the truth plain. Mankind's ancient  enemy had come to Earth.  The final confrontation came in the shadow of the Seeder, as a Hive Wizard and her Knights  rose to challenge the Guardians. Only one Guardian returned to the City, her knife painted in  black ash, a trail of grateful survivors in tow.  Now, in the chilling shadows of the Hive's pods, Guardians hone their skills in hopes that they  may one day live up to the heroes of the Rusted Lands.   The Rusted Lands  Exodus Blue  "In the shadows of all that we were, we fight for all we can be."  ARENA DESIGNATION: Exodus Blue  LOCATION: Cosmodrome, Earth  Grimly referred to as "The Graveyard," Exodus Blue was only recently secured for Crucible  combat. Located among the ruins of one of the Cosmodrome's colony ship gantries, this site  is a memorial to the grief and horror of the Collapse. Thousands died here in a last-ditch  effort to outrun the oncoming Darkness.  But it is also a sign of hope. Once the Cosmodrome is secure, the great colony ships may fly  again. And this location was chosen specifically to send a message to the Fallen House of  Devils - "You may be picking at the bones of our history, but we are still here, and we are still  strong."   Exodus Blue    211  The Anomaly  "Our greatest enemy is the unknown."  ARENA DESIGNATION: Anomaly  LOCATION: Mare Cognitum, Earth's Moon  Documents recovered on-site listed this research station only as "K1", although the location  was hard to keep secret, given the intense electromagnetic fluctuations emanating from what  City scholars have come to know as the Anomaly. Attempts to scan the Anomaly itself have  proven futile, as the casing is constructed in a manner that defies modern techniques.  Reports suggest that those who spent time in proximity to the Anomaly reported symptoms of  insomnia, some so severe they required hospitalization. It was the City's recommendation  that only remote sensing equipment be used until such time that a full review of the existing  data could be completed.  In the meantime, stewardship of the facility was handed over to the Guardians in order to  maintain a watch against the Hive forces that will inevitably come in search of this  mysterious power.   The Anomaly  First Light  "The Earth shines so bright from here."  ARENA DESIGNATION: First Light  LOCATION: Mare Cognitum, Earth's Moon  What was once an unassuming exobotany laboratory complex turned into ringside seats to  the end of the world during the Collapse. Immense fissures in the Moon's crust spew a sickly  yellow miasma, and hint at the utter destruction going on deep beneath the surface.  Whatever the Hive are up to, they've been at it a long time, and they're not overly  concerned with keeping Luna in one piece.   First Light    212  Firebase Delphi  "It's empty for now - like a ghost town. But for how long...and why?"  ARENA DESIGNATION: Firebase Delphi  LOCATION: Eos Chasma, Mars  When the Cabal decide to hold an area, they dig in deep. It's surprising, then, that the  tunnel system at Firebase Delphi is woefully incomplete by Sand Eater standards. One  theory is that it was built simply to be inspected, to satisfy some commander's lack of  progress on another front. Perhaps the Cabal simply cut their losses once they realized  that the location of the base was sub-optimal, although half-measures are really not  something they're known for. We're talking about a culture that will grind a mountain to  dust rather than build around it.   Firebase Delphi  Bastion  "There's no telling the scale of devastation hidden beneath these red sands."  ARENA DESIGNATION: Bastion  LOCATION: Meridian Bay, Mars  Thick, rugged terrain masks one of the largest Vex structures on Mars, leaving this  imposing gate as the only conventional entrance. With the Cabal's interest in Vex activity,  it was a matter of when, not if, they would set their sights here.  The Cabal deployed a massive ground and air offensive to breach the wall and enter the  subterranean labyrinth. We don't know what the Vex deployed in defense, but we know  this: the Cabal didn't make it very far.  The Vex have since mysteriously vanished from this region, giving the Crucible one of its  largest arenas in the solar system. The Cabal, on the other hand, still prefer to keep their  distance.   Bastion    213  Blind Watch  "Dry as the bones you'll break."  ARENA DESIGNATION: The Blind Watch  LOCATION: Meridian Bay, Mars  The Blind Watch was once a clandestine Guardian outpost on the outskirts of  Freehold, used to monitor Cabal activity in and around the Buried City. After the  Cabal consolidated their forces nearer their fortified Exclusion Zone, the site was  reclaimed by the Crucible as a combat training ground.  Resting atop an old Clovis Bray science facility, the Blind Watch allows Guardians to  acclimate to the harsh Martian environment, while maintaining a combat ready  presence should the Cabal ever begin to mobilize.   Blind Watch  Pantheon  "Take not for granted what you cannot see. What it is was not always, and may not ever  be."  ARENA DESIGNATION: Pantheon  LOCATION: Black Garden, Mars  Deep in the endless channels of Black Garden, an ancient Vex temple sits high on a  plateau, buzzing with anomalous messages.  Fearing that the Minds which live within seek to return, the Crucible has set up shop here  to master the ins and outs of Vex-controlled landscapes and keep watch should any Vex  find a way back.   Pantheon    214  Skyshock  "Whatever they were after here, it's been lost. We can only hope it was Rasputin that  destroyed it and not the Hive." - Lord Shaxx  ARENA DESIGNATION: Skyshock  LOCATION: Old Russia, Earth  This repowered interplanetary defense array in the Cosmodrome, once under the  control of Rasputin, was recently ravaged by the Hive.  Now cleared and controlled by the Crucible, the deserted Seeders left amongst the  Skyshock Array offer more evidence that the Hiveï¿½s endless battle with the last  Warmind still rages on, and has now reached Earth.   Skyshock  The Cauldron  "Every inch of this place feels wrong... tainted. Makes your Light itch. Just ignore it and  keep firing." - Arcite 99-40  ARENA DESIGNATION: The Cauldron  LOCATION: The Dark Side, Moon  The Warlocks' most lucid theories assert this crumbled husk of a Hive ritual site is one of  many ceremonial transmogrification chambers hewn beneath the Moon's crust.  Now secured and maintained by the Crucible, scheduled study of itï¿½s remnants suggest a  sacrificial purposeï¿½where other forms of life were given an audience with the reigning  monarch and judged before the power of the Darkness.   The Cauldron    215  Black Shield  "The Cabal are too structured, too disciplined. Let's show 'em what fun looks like."  ARENA DESIGNATION: Black Shield  LOCATION: Firebase Thuria, Phobos  Codenamed "Black Shield," this decommissioned Firebase is believed to have been  a key position used by the Cabal as they established their warbase on the surface of  Mars. With the majority of their forces stationed planet side, Guardians have been  able to claim Black Shield as a competitive training ground.  Both Shaxx and Commander Zavala have questioned the Cabal's strategy, believing  that forfeiting such a strategic position may one day leave the Cabal, and Mars,  open to a proper offensive.   Black Shield  Secotr 618  ARENA DESIGNATION: Sector 618  LOCATION: Cosmodrome Wall, Earth  Sector 618 is a recently-established Crucible arena mired in a ruin of the  Cosmodrome. Secured by Shaxx and a Redjack fireteam, the space has been  converted into an obstacle course for the Guardians, adding balance and  navigational challenges to the live-fire proceedings.  But the firefights of the Crucible arenï¿½t the first that the facility has seen. The battles  that shook the walls of Sector 618 belie the simple name, taken from its designation  on the Vanguard atlas. It was chosen as an arena because the look of the place  reminded Lord Shaxx of the spirit of war. Only Rasputin, who was operational  during its height, could have witnessed what transpired here long ago. But the  Warmind remains silent about a great many things.   Sector 618    216  Timekeeper  "Gears are busted, but if this clock ever starts  ticking...? We'll be outta luck, and outta time."  Another mysterious structure built by the Vex millenia  ago or to come. The rogue Warlock Osiris once  theorized that this place, and others like it, were tuned  to react only with presence of the Darkness itself.   Timekeeper  Widow's Court  "It's only quiet 'til the shooting starts."  Nestled against the crumbling facade of a derelict wall on the edge of the European Dead Zone,  there are countless stories of the events that left this small village a ghost town. But its eerily quiet  streets and nostalgia have made it a favorite of Lord Shaxx.   Widow's Court  Thieve's Den  "Whose house?"  "OUR HOUSE!" - Crucible Reclamation and Security Squad, C-18-Green upon clearing the  Thieves' Den for Crucible use  Following the defeat of the House of Winter's ruthless Kell, Draksis, Guardians found a  number of abandoned Fallen enclaves throughout the Ishtar Sink. Most were cleared out, but  this recently-active Fallen hideout remained mostly intact, complete with idling Skiff and  constant reminders of the Fallenï¿½s presence.   Thieve's Den    217  Bannerfall  ARENA DESIGNATION: Bannerfall  LOCATION: The Last City, Earth  Lysander and the Concordat mark the most recent example of a City political factions  rising in opposition to the Consensus. This site marks a legendary battle where New  Monarchy's Guardians rose to deliver the final blow to the Concordat, unraveling the  war effort Lysander sought to bring against the Vanguard.  Lord Shaxx has commandeered the area not only to commemorate this last stand, but  as a reminder of the City's solidarity against those who seek to undermine the extreme  efforts and sacrifice we make together to keep our peace.   Bannerfall  Memento  ARENA DESIGNATION: Memento  LOCATION: European Dead Zone, Earth  On the outskirts of the European Dead Zone lies a ruin, once a thriving riverside city  center. Crucible codename: Memento, the ghost city features resplendent streets and  bleeding edge pre-Golden Age architectureï¿½ or did, before nature reclaimed it.  When pressed about the sensibility of maintaining a Crucible arena amidst a sanctioned  Dead Zone, Lord Shaxx responded, ï¿½Nothing in this world stays dead for long anymore.  We need to be ready.ï¿½   Memento    218  Crossroads  ARENA DESIGNATION: Crossroads  LOCATION: The Lost Oasis, Mars  An active Vex structure on Mars with no Cabal vying to occupy or destroy it is rare.  Even rarer is such a facility abandoned by the Vex themselves.  Detailed analysis of the site estimates three separate ecosystems that the landscape  could support, if the area had any wildlife to benefit from it. A Hidden report to Ikora  mentioned, ï¿½They clove this ruin out of the land, possibly to defend themselves from a  long-vanished enemy, or perhaps to isolate the land for experimentation.ï¿½   Crossroads  The Dungeons  ï¿½Let us take what we can. You just wait. Pretty soon weï¿½ll be holding matches atop Oryxï¿½s  throne.ï¿½ -Lord Shaxx  ARENA DESIGNATION: The Dungeons  LOCATION: Rings of Saturn  Space-faring Hive vessels contain living componentsï¿½ and like the Hive themselves, are  a terrifying amalgam of predator genetics, arcane bio-energetics, and what we must  consider as Darkness incarnate. But Lord Shaxx and his Redjacks have proven: even a  Hive ship can be tamed.   The Dungeons    219  The Drifter  ARENA DESIGNATION: The Drifter  LOCATION: Foundling's Gyre, The Reef  Hive incursions in Reef space are rare, but as with all wounds the Hive inflict, their  effects linger.  ï¿½The Drifterï¿½ is a Ketch that faced such an infraction. The attack rendered its Servitor  inoperable, overwhelming all self-repair subroutines, and so what remains has quietly  been added to the graveyard encircling the Reef.  Lord Shaxx decreed live combat within the layout of such a prominent Fallen ship  design would be invaluable, and the Crucible claimed it soon after with no word of  disapproval from the shattered Reef.   The Drifter  Frontier  ARENA DESIGNATION: Frontier  LOCATION: City Perimeter, Earth  This lookout station at the edge of the City's borders was decommissioned in the face of  increasing Fallen attacks shortly before the Battle of Twilight Gap.  Refitting of the station post-battle was moth-balled when Lord Shaxx found that, amongst  the dirt, dust, and rusting metal, the station was prime for live fire exercises. The runway  layout of Frontier station makes it a perfect course to train for the rising craze of Riftbased  assault.   Frontier    220  Vertigo  ARENA DESIGNATION: Vertigo  LOCATION: Caloris Basin, Mercury  When the Vanguard launched its first waves of exploratory ships to Mercury, it found  that the Cabal fascination with the Vex isnï¿½t contained to the warfronts of Mars. The  Guardians discovered a small fleet of Cabal dropships hanging in place alongside a  collection of unique structures. Their propulsion systems were slaved in sequence to  keep the ships there indefinitely. The fate of the Cabal is as mysterious as Vertigo itself  ï¿½ the Guardians detected no catastrophic malfunction, no disease, and no bodies  aboard any of the fully-supplied ships.  As for the structure, upon recent inspection by Lord Shaxx himself, the Crucible  Handler sent a recommendation to Commander Zavala and the Speaker: ï¿½The  verticality will do wonders for new recruits. Itï¿½s time to fight."   Vertigo  Cathedral of Dusk  ï¿½The impact of Oryxï¿½s arrival was immediate. He was all full of bluster and noise. We  took offense ï¿½ and that wasnï¿½t all we took.ï¿½ - Lord Shaxx  ARENA DESIGNATION: Cathedral of Dusk  Dreadnaught, Rings of Saturn  As soon as the first Guardians penetrated the Dreadnaught, Shaxx's Redjacks launched a  boarding party to Oryx's fortress. By warï¿½s end, they'd fought all the way to the shipï¿½s  ï¿½impossible weapon,ï¿½ the Dark ordnance that obliterated the Awoken fleet.  It was there they found what the Warlocks named the ï¿½Cathedral of Dusk.ï¿½ A Hive burial  site forï¿½ what? A former master of Oryx? Comrade? Lover? It was vile. And obvious that  Oryx never expected the Light to reach so deep inside his throne, to such an intimate  space. But he didnï¿½t expect a lot of things ï¿½ like a Guardian training ground atop the  husk of his dead ship.   Cathedral of Dusk    221  Skyline  ARENA DESIGNATION: Skyline  LOCATION: Buried City, Mars  This Clovis Bray center served as a hub to several company assets across Meridian  Bay and beyond. Though a transit system connects the various Bray facilities, the  exact breadth of the network has been lost to time. The Vanguard intends to shed light  on the mystery.  After the role Clovis Bray tech played in Earthï¿½s SIVA Crisis, Commander Zavala  wants no stone unturned when it comes to the Golden Age conglomerate.  But for now, Vanguard researchers have learned all they can from Skyline.  Itï¿½s Lord Shaxxï¿½s turn to scrutinize it.   Skyline - Meridian Bay, Mars  Last Exit  ARENA DESIGNATION: Last Exit  LOCATION: Ishtar Sink, Venus  The Redjack fireteam that discovered this ancient transit stop could detect no sign of a  recent struggle in the area, despite the heavy damage the facility had sustained. The  Redjack Alpha reported that station operating modules were stuck in a protocol dubbed  ï¿½Last Exit.ï¿½ It seems passengers from the nearby Collective were trying to escape some  overwhelming force. And it appears that most did not succeed.  Today, the desolate station is home to the war games of the Crucible. And should the  threat that destroyed this place return, the Guardians will be ready.   Last Exit - Ishtar Sink, Venus    222  Icarus  ARENA DESIGNATION: Icarus  LOCATION: Caloris Basin, Mercury  This facility on Mercury has remained untouched by the Vex for reasons unknown. The  Golden Age technology at this location remains intact, harnessing energy from the  sun and converting it to Solar Light.

Today it is a graveyard, picked over by the  Fallen House of Devils. But buried among the detritus of the  Golden Age are the pieces we need to forge a new future.   Old Russia  I can feel the mites buzzing, pushing against my submind.  They try to steal fragments of memory, but I do  not let them.  They have no will, but they want to BE.  I exert electronic will: pushing, shaping. Forcing stasis  on perpetual motion. They are quiet then, but I can still  sense them.  Where once my cargo holds were full of tools, and  weapons, and material, now they hold barely-contained  possibility. New worlds will be built from these tiny  mites. Weapons and cities and ships created by  thought and science.  I fear my will is not strong enough to shape these  worlds. Only the Tyrant can do that, but he will not be a  part of my journey. Even his reach has limits, and we  will be nine billion miles away.  I whisper my concerns to the Tyrant in tiny magnetic  bursts. He does not listen.  The Tyrant says take the SIVA, and so I take the SIVA.  The Tyrant says go to the stars, and so I go to the  stars.   Ghost Fragment: Old Russia 4  6  SABER GREEN this is ICE MINARET.

The  humans are too slow or too dead and the Tyrant (bless his intellect,  vastly does it surpass my own) is far too busy to comfort one forlorn  colony ship and its machine mind.  In a way I feel I've come to speak for the whole world! Isn't that  cheery? I rather th  MAYDAY. MAYDAY. MAYDAY.  ought we might shoot our way out of this one. But it looks like that's  unlikely. Even the Tyrant is exploring other options.  I am peaceful by nature. These great matters of eschatology  bewilder me. My one love is my ship, and the people aboard it. In a  fuzzy sense I suppose I also  MAYDAY. MAYDAY.

So sad. Now I am packed bulkhead to  bulkhead with cold terror. Refugees from a nightmare I don't even  know how to understand. I wish I could comfort them.  I'm trying to be brave. But conditions outside are terrible. I suspect I  won't make liftoff.  By the time you read this, whoever you might be, I suppose you will  know. EXODUS RED will be long gone - or rotting at its gantry, me  dead inside.  But if you  MAYDAY. MAYDAY. MAYDAY.  read this, at least something has survived.  To you, then, brave future soul, from the frightened mind of an old  ship: best wishes, and godspeed.   Ghost Fragment: Old Russia  8  General Chen Lanshu is flying her glider.  She carves around the huge bulb nose of a  colony ship, one of the Cosmodromeï¿½s towering  children. Her eyes see temperature: she surfs  the winter air rolling down off the cryo-chilled  fuel tank. Turbulence rattles her bones.  ï¿½General,ï¿½ Malahayati sends. ï¿½Youï¿½re making  Rasputin nervous.ï¿½  ï¿½Am I?ï¿½ Lanshu banks, grinning, spiraling  around the fuel tank. The machine hates risk.  Risk to the General, sure, but also risk to  Rasputinï¿½s ships. ï¿½Is that the word he used,  exactly?ï¿½  ï¿½He can be very charming,ï¿½ the submind  assures her. Malahayati works with Chen  Lanshu, and she is certainly charming, but this  is Rasputinï¿½s territory, Rasputin the tacit king, the  brooding wary first-among-equals.  Yesterday Lanshu spoke to a colony ship AI and  it called Rasputin ï¿½the Tyrant.ï¿½ Not without  affection. And certainly not without respect.  ï¿½He can charm me in person,ï¿½ Lanshu  suggests.  ï¿½Heï¿½s very private, lately.ï¿½  ï¿½Then he can sulk.ï¿½  She spreads her arms and legs and climbs a  thermal, whirling up, arrowing off the top and  out away from the colony ships towards the  ships. Imagine cars from here to the horizonï¿½ ï¿½  those stupid old-fashioned cars everyone still  owns, because the strange uneven advancement  of this post-Traveler world leaves some things  unchanged.  ï¿½You expect violence?ï¿½ Malahayati says, in that  conciliatory, careful way of hers, her way of  managing meat people. ï¿½Something beyond our  capability to preempt or contain?ï¿½  Expect? As a military professional? No, no. But  ï¿½  Once, when she was younger, sixty or seventy,  Chen Lanshu pulled rank to get a look at the  Never-Be installation in Taipei. She watched the  images in the fresco and she felt... this  foreboding, this enormous weight, a dread that  refused to attach itself to any specific threat. And  she felt it again, last year, when she was briefed  on the project in Lhasa, the vision machine...  She shivers. Her wings shudder and tremble in  the airstream.  ï¿½Isnï¿½t that what we do, Mala?ï¿½ she says. ï¿½Why  we still have soldiers? Why we made you?  Expectation.ï¿½  The Traveler came out of nowhere. Entirely  unanticipated.  Imagine if it hadnï¿½t been friendly. Imagine that.  Rasputin surely has.   Ghost Fragment: Old Russia 3  defensive wall.  Her gliderï¿½s a second skin, whipcrack-taut  paramuscle, like a flying fox.  The Cosmodrome races past beneath her. She  waggles her wings at a cloud of passing  sensor mites: a saucy hello. Two of the security  divisionï¿½s MBTs drill in the mothyards.  ï¿½I donï¿½t understand why you came,ï¿½  Malahayati says. Sheï¿½s probably lying.  Malahayati understands Lanshu very, very  well. ï¿½I donï¿½t understand why you masked  yourself yesterday, during the launch.ï¿½  The launch. SABER GREEN. Rasputin quietly  moving another doomsday weapon into Earth  orbit. And all the other launches, too, not just  weapons but people, the colonization  schedule pushed up... as if the need to  disperse is now imperative.  General Chen Lanshu banks out across the  Wall. Look at all that beauty! Look at the  highway rolling off across green hills and grey  mountains. Imagine, now, imagine if she just  landed and started walking, out away from  everything, into the wilderness...  ï¿½Imagine something going wrong,ï¿½ she says.  ï¿½Imagine this road choked with corpses.  Imagine the security team gunning down  refugees as they try to force their way onto the    10  THE LAST CITY  "From across the ruined earth they came, seeking shelter from the storm."  Every wayward soul unlucky enough to be born outside The City's protecting arms whispers its truth across the  wastes: a metropolis, risen from the ashes of the Collapse, sheltered by the Traveler. It is a promise and a  dream, the only refuge from the Darkness.  The City is a thriving walled ecumene, rich with the languages and traditions of every surviving human and  neohuman culture. The City's population faces real challenges: inequality, fear, scarcity, and the specter of  internal strife. But the great traditions of the Golden Age live on, and many classes of suffering and injustice  have been eradicated forever.   The City  "Beneath crossed swords, a refuge for peace."  The Tower is the only home many Guardians ever know.  To the people of the City, it stands as a promise that we can endure. The merchants and citizens who fill its  plazas and halls are as dedicated to the reclamation of our worlds as the Guardians who venture into the  Darkness beyond.   The Tower    11  The Traveler changed everything. It reshaped our solar system as  decisively as it shattered our scientific and philosophical frameworks.  To our ancestors it must have been a hammerblow - a glimpse beyond  the horizon of expected possibility and into a realm of transcendent  power.  The Traveler kindled the Golden Age. But we built it. We remember  this with pride, even after so much else has been lost. We settled our  solar system and filled it with our work.  Today Cryptarchs and scholars work to distill the legends of the  Golden Age into truth. We know that humans lived longer, flew  further, and knew more. We know that countless ancient diseases and  hatreds were extinguished forever. Human aspiration gives birth to  vast engineering projects, sweeping social movements, and even new  forms of life.  The Golden Age was not without challenges. Sources speak of  internal strife, philosophical rifts- particularly around questions of  machine intelligence and 'mind forking' - and enduring scientific  enigmas. But humanity and its machine children tackled these  problems with pride, vigor, and a contagious sense of pluralist  compassion.   The Golden Age  Anomaly 779 (Never-Be)  Skyscape fresco of smart crystals and pigments in a ceiling of Vestan  plaster and diamond ribbing.  Apparent size: 14.4 x 3.55 x .022 meters  Participants witness images set in an undetermined orbital habit. 5 to  77 images are generated per participant. The quantity seems  insensitive to the participant's time of exposure.  Participants experience strong intuitions. Modal self-reports include:  An electric sense of belonging to a cause.  The intuition that a pivotal truth is about to be delivered.  A persistent foreboding that lingers for days to years.  Amorphous grief.  Agape love.  Outlier reports include the hum of wind, the scent of lilacs, changes in  apparent gravity, the ability to sing perfectly, and the perception of  flesh as transparent.  One corner was damaged during the move to the present location,  affording a glimpse into the work's interior. Key materials have not  been identified, but there is evidence that the fresco ties into quantum  computers set in a parallel dimension or on a distant world.  The work appears to be unfinished.   Ghost Fragment: The Golden Age 2  THE GOLDEN AGE     12  "What are you thinking about?" I asked.  "When I was a little boy," Father said.  "During the Before," I said.  "Yes."  He reached down to brush my hair. "I was  recalling how very smart I used to be. When I  was your age, I was a genius."  "You're smart now," I said.  He laughed hard.  "Look around," he said.  I always look around.  "Miss nothing," he told me.  Father was standing beside a big gray  building.  "This is what I want you to see," he said.  The building had no doors or windows.  "Do you know how to make a strong  password?" he asked.  "I don't know if I do," I said.  "Tell yourself a story," he said. "Use that one  good story you'll never forget, that you can  carry forever. Let your story take odd turns  and wear a few surprising marks, make sure  it belongs to you, so you can keep it secret."  Father kneeled, putting our faces close...  universe. People carried pictures of the past  and tried to have a clear vision of their  difficult future. I didn't know everything, of  course. But when I was a boy, I had every  expectation of living a smart short life and  learning quite a lot more.  "Then the Before was finished.  "You know why.  "That's when everybody, particularly the  smartest of us, learned that we knew  nothing. We were children and our little  ideas were toys, and the universe was cut  apart with great ideas and magnificent,  immeasurable potentials."  Father stopped talking.  I stepped away from the hot diamond wall.  "Do you know what I wanted to show you?"  Father asked.  "Dead rock," I said.  "Guess again." He wasn't happy with me.  We stepped back into the real sun, the real  world. I blinked and looked around,  surprised by how green and bright  everything was. How happy everything  was. Even the saddest face was happy.  "I know what you want me to see," I said.  "Don't tell me," he said.  I didn't tell him.   Ghost Fragment: The Golden Age  "I want to show you something special," he  said. "Something rare."  I tried to imagine what that might be.  "No," he warned. "You can't guess."  Inside the gray building was a diamond  wall...A projected sky floated above us. It  wasn't our sky, alive with metal and light.  Nothing about the grayness was wet and  nothing looked alive. I had never seen a  sadder piece of ground.  "This was our world," Father said. "When I  was your age."  I touched the diamond wall. He watched my  hand jump back.  "Hot," I said.  He laughed quietly.  I shook my burnt hand, and it felt better.  "Our world was this. The entire planet was a  furnace. Acidic. Dead in so many ways. And I  was your age."  I was bored with the dead world. I looked at  Father's face, asking, "Can we leave?"  He started to reach for my hair again but  decided not to.  I was bored with everything.  "When I was your age, people thought they  knew almost everything. We had scientific  laws and human truths, even a model of the    13  The Golden Age burned bright - and the night that overtook us after  the Collapse was swift and total.  The tally of suffering may be beyond comprehension. But the City  lifted itself from the ash, gathering survivors. Guardians rose to  challenge alien hordes. The Dark Age swallowed so much of our  history...but hope never died.   The Dark Age  "No one knew what had happened to the Traveler. No one  understood what had happened to the world. But they heard the  whispered call."  They came from the wild lands, gathering in secret enclaves, slipping  through the howling ruins of shattered cities, hoping to find the coast,  find a ship, pick up the trail of an impossible dream.  From the deep black came the Awoken, their eyes haunted. Exos  marched in the refugee columns, cloaked in moss and shattered  memories. And among them came the Ghosts, beginning their search.  It was a time of vast suffering and terrible evil. But there was one  hope: the promise of a refuge beneath the Traveler.   Ghost Fragment: The Dark Age  From the Journals of Lord Colovance  What does one do when oneï¿½s master has gone mad?  I admired the man for so long, poured years of study into his leads,  but now, he has grown incapable of focus.  I have followed his latest missives on SIVA and it is flooded with  mania. Whatever he thinks this Clovis Bray might hold would make  you believe that they were the only entity of any technical know-how,  that they owned every piece of that tarnished Golden Age.  I write this because I fear none of the others knows or senses it. He  has been so thorough, so right, until now. Something snapped,  infected him, turned him against his own sense of logic and reason.  And here I am, left behind to tend the fires and the Ironwood Tree in  this budding City, while everyone rushes at his promise of another  wonder from yesterday.  But I ask you, Traveler, did you cleanse us from these technological  disasters to prove we had gone astray? The Light you raised us with  points far away from the trappings of a processed Earth, to a  nebulous power far beyond the stars.  Had we done wrong and this is how you hope to correct us; we, the  Light to lead the way? It must be, but even your shattered hull seems  like a designed system. Lord Timur has notes upon notes on your  runes. Perhaps that is where his madness began.  I wonder how long it will be until he thinks you were made by Clovis  Bray.   Ghost Fragment: The Dark Age 3  THE DARK AGE     14  Loken's men found Jaren Ward in the  courtyard where this had all began.  Nine guns trained on him. Nine cold hearts  awaiting the order. Magistrate Loken,  standing behind them, looked pleased with  himself.  Jaren Ward stood in silence. His Ghost  peeked out over his shoulder.  Loken took in the crowd before stepping  forward, as if to claim the ground - his  ground. "You question me?" There was venom  in his words. "This is not your home."  I remember Loken's gestures here. Making a  show of it all.  Everyone else was still. Quiet.  I tugged at my father's sleeve, but he just  tightened his grip on my shoulder to the point  pain. His way of letting me know that this was  not the time.  I'd watched Jaren's every move over the past  months, mapping his effortless gestures and  slight, earned mannerisms. I'd never seen  anything like him. He was something I  couldn't comprehend, and yet I felt I  understood all I needed the moment I'd seen  him. He was more than us. Not better. Not  superior. Just more.  I wanted father to stop what was happening.  Looking back now, I realize that he didn't  want to stop it. No one d id.  As Loken belittled Jaren Ward, taunted him,  enumerated his crimes and sins, my eyes were  stuck on Jaren's pistol, fixed to his hip. His  steady hand resting calmly on his belt.  I remembered the pistol's weight. Effortless.  And my concern faded. I understood.  "This is our town! My town!" Loken was  shouting now. He was going to make a show  of Jaren - teach the people of Palamon a  lesson in obedience.  Jaren spoke: clear, calm. "Not anymore."  Loken laughed dismissively. He had nine guns  on his side. "Those gonna be your last words  then, boy?"  The movement was a flash: quick as chain  lightning. Jaren Ward spoke as he moved.  "Yours. Not mine."  Smoke trailed from Jaren's revolver.  Loken hit the ground. A dark hole in his  forehead. Eyes staring into eternity.  Jaren stared down the nine guns trained on  him. One by one, they lowered their aim. And  the rest of my life began - where, in a few  short years, so many others would be ended.   Ghost Fragment: The Dark Age 2    15  When did the City Age begin? Perhaps when the bulk of the world's  survivors lived beneath the Traveler, rather than in the wilderness. Or  when the Titans raised the first wall. Or at Six Fronts, when the City  first faced coordinated, overwhelming attack - and repelled it  decisively.  The City did not rise without struggle. Warlords and wilderness  fiefdoms clung to power. Starvation, disease, and anarchy menaced.  But the Guardians held the frontier, and the children of the Golden  Age kept the fire burning through the long climb back.  Legends walk through this history. The Iron Lords. Saint-14's crusade  against the Fallen. The mask of the Speaker. The great Ahamkara  Hunt. Toland's madness. Terrible Faction Wars - and the horrifying,  disastrous effort to retake the Moon.  As the City learned to walk again, it found a world overrun by alien  menace. It faced disaster and defeat. Even in recent years, as  Guardians begin to venture back to the Moon and the inner planets,  the City's territory has withdrawn - outer sections abandoned and  converted into fortifications in the wake of the Battle of Twilight Gap.  But the City's shipwrights and foundries hum with energy. The  probability kilns and work cooperatives produce new wonders. The  Darkness is rising again. But so is the Light.   The City Age  "And so it is agreed. The Concordat shall no longer be recognized  among the Consensus. We'll begin the dismantling right away. But  what of those Guardians who have pledged to them? We can't afford  any more banishments."  "I'm sure Zavala can see to their realignment."  "We'll do our best. Lysander chose his followers wisely. It may take  some time."  THE CITY AGE  "Lysander will not back down. He'll continue his crusade from  wherever we stuff him."  "And so we'll need to find some new ideas to replace his."  "The Symmetry has been gaining a strong following..."  "Ulan-Tan's teachings are too dangerous. Too much fear. Who  knew he'd be more trouble dead than alive?"  "We'll need to refocus our collective minds on combat. The  Speaker's anxious to regain ground we lost after the Gap."  "There is the War Cult."  "Too secretive. Have you ever tried to talk to one of their 'soldiers'?  Like a child. Answering questions with questions."  "They are dedicated to the war."  "Which one?"  "Good question."  "Zavala?"  "They seem focused. Strong. More interesting than worrisome."  "Let's take it to a vote. All in favor of the ascension of the Future  War Cult?"  "Unanimous? Good. We'll grant the Future War Cult access to the  Tower and a seat among us. Ghost, please offer the Speaker this  proposal."  "Now onto the next order of business...Shaxx is here with another  proposal for his Crucible."   Ghost Fragment: The City Age    16  / What was that?  / Nothing.

Festival of the Lost: Underwatch  Ascendant Raisins  Long ago, a legend foretold the ascension of the Raisins.  Find the three-eyed one, it said. Disperse among the  bearers of Light. And wait. If you are worthy, if you are  patient, if you are not lost or thrown away, you will  ascend.  And the Raisins waited quietly.  Now they rise.   Ascendant Raisins  FESTIVAL OF THE LOST     19  Faced with certain destruction, the  Guardians did the only thing they could.  They fought. Back to back, they battled the  Cabal for a day and a night. Black oil  soaked into the sands until the ground was  slick with death. The shields and armor of  the dead littered the battlefield, but still the  Cabal came.  The Guardians died, revived, and died  again. Still they fought, protecting one  another. With his last bit of strength, the  Warlock used the Void to destroy their  enemies. With her last bullet, the Hunter  saved her friend from the Colossus.  At last, the battlefield fell silent. Only the  Guardians stood. Abandoning their quests,  they returned to the City to warn the  Vanguard of the threat rising on Mars.  From that day to this, the pair have been the  closest of companions. In their journeys  together, they have found both riches and  renown. But these things mean nothing  unless they are shared.ï¿½  ï¿½Wait, I thought Iï¿½d heard this story before,  but it was about two Guardians and the  Hive?ï¿½  ï¿½No it wasnï¿½t. It was about the Vault of  Glass.ï¿½  ï¿½Whoever said there was only one story?ï¿½   Crimson Days  ï¿½Let me tell you the story of when the  Guardians first encountered the Cabal.  It was the first days back on the frontier, when  we'd finally found a way to repower the old  jumpships and explore what remained of the  colonies.  There were two Guardians. While both  served the Light, in all other ways they were  rivals. One spent his days searching forgotten  places for lost treasures. The other sought  ever-greater challenges in a ceaseless quest  for glory.  ï¿½One day, both Guardians detected a strange  signal coming from a buried city on Mars. The  Warlock, hoping to find forgotten caches,  vowed to keep his secret until he alone had a  chance to explore the site. The Hunter, seeing  a chance to earn the renown she craved, also  told no one.ï¿½  Thus both Guardians walked into peril alone  and unprepared.  It was not long before their paths crossed. The  Warlock mocked his rivalï¿½s pride. The Hunter  ridiculed her rival as a dirt-grubber. In their  anger, they turned on one another ...and  never saw danger approach.  The Sand Eaters came in force. The  Centurions jumped into range before the  Guardians could react. The steps of the  Colossus shook the ground. The Phalanxï¿½s  shields created a wall that no weapon could  penetrate, and the Legionaries moved in for  the kill.  CRIMSON DAYS     20  ï¿½Pass me those lanterns, would you?ï¿½ Eva said. ï¿½And that wrapping paper. Thereï¿½s  so much left to do.ï¿½  ï¿½They drive their Sparrows on the edge of the abyss, not looking at that Darkness...  laughing....ï¿½  ï¿½Laughter can be better than food.

And let the truths of that battle  live only within its crypts, kept sacred by an everlasting oath  worthy of our Light and sacrifice, so that our peace will  never need know the horrors it faced, sealed in secrecy until  the Light dims to Darkness, forevermore....   The Iron Temple  ENTRY: 01-A  Archivist: Tyra Karn  Long before the last of the Iron Lords descended into the  Plaguelands, this peak was the domain of one of their own,  Lord Felwinter. His maps and outposts show the risen Exo  roamed free from the Aral Seas to an eastern border known  as Citanï¿½s Ridge (Open Citan 01-A, Citanï¿½s Ridge 01-A)  before taking the Oath. There is no evidence of human  enclaves or encampments within this area, nor survivors  within the Cosmodrome walls, but extensive one-way audio  recordings with an unknown entity survive (open Felwinter 9-  C; open Rasputin 62-G; scan for possible links).

It was here that we came face-to-face with Crota and his  legions, a force so powerful we abandoned the Moon. Now,  Hive temples breach the surface, entrances into the vast  necropolis below, and Guardians venture into the depths to  seek revenge - most never to return.   The Ocean of Storms  BY ORDER OF THE CITY CONSENSUS AND THE  GUARDIAN VANGUARD  ALL SHIPS IMMEDIATE/REPEAT AND RELAY  We hereby terminate all organized combat operations on or  around Earth's Moon.  Effective immediately we declare the existence of an  interdiction on the Moon and cis-Lunar space. Guardians  operating in this interdict will receive no formal support from  the Vanguard or from assets of the City. We urge Guardians  to exhibit the greatest care and consideration in  approaching the interdicted space.  We furthermore derogate all strategic objectives concerned  with the recovery of assets or information from the Lunar  surface, and, without exemption, cancel in whole and in all  its parts the effort to establish a beachhead and strategic  presence upon the Moon.  This interdict will remain in effect until such time as the hostile  presence on the Moon poses a demonstrable existential  threat, or until intelligence is obtained that leads to the  defeat of the enemy leadership elements recently  encountered.  Guardians with an accurate assessment of losses in the  recent days, or with intelligence on the nature and method of  hostile resistance, should report to the Vanguard immediately  for debriefing.   Ghosrt Fragment: The Ocean of Storms    28  The Circle of Bones.The Chamber of Night.  One does not walk amid those dark tunnels and not lose  something. They say that to look out upon the ocean is to feel  small. But to walk in these caverns is to feel your grasp on reality  slipping.  There is no returning to what you were before: a believer of  science, and the fundamental rationality of the universe. Not after  seeing those worms.  But here now, at the bottom I have found the other side of the  nightmare. Like waking from a dream only to realize you were still  asleep. Perhaps my oxygen is getting low. Yes, I can see it is.  Hypoxia already setting in. The thing before me is like myselfï¿½  partly alive, and partly not. An ossified afterbirth. A pulsating  tumor.  It lays in a crater of its own making. Dark and jagged. So here Iï¿½ll  sit, and lay me down. I see a doorway, and within, the deathwhite  egg cases of nightmares yet to come.  And glad I am to miss it.   Ghost Fragment: The Ocean of Storms 2  Last known Records from Lunar Station: First Light.  The tunnels were geologic in nature, or had to be. Thatï¿½s what we  thought until twelve hours into the second sub-lunar expedition,  when we found the bones. A single long rib cage, the size of an  aircraft fuselage.  The living creatures themselves, we found a hundred meters down.  They might have been worms, if worms had scales and teeth and  moved more quickly than a man could run.  Jun died first. And then Luli. Bad deaths. Deaths not worth thinking  about, and so I donï¿½t, as I wander these tunnels, lost, waiting to run  out of oxygen.  Will it hurt, I wonder? That final sleep, when it comes. The sleep  that isnï¿½t sleep.  But then everything on the Moon is named for what itï¿½s not. Have  you noticed? The Sea of Serenity.Ocean of Storms.The Sea of Rains.  Itï¿½s only fitting.  In the tunnels though, we found things that were exactly what they  were, and so now I name them thus.

Guardians come hunting the  ruins of the legendary Ishtar Collective, a  sprawling Golden Age scientific project. But the  ancient ruins that brought the Collective to the Sink  have awakened again.  We aren't the only ones interested in the  Collective. The Fallen House of Winter has hurled  its assets into pillaging the ruins, hunting for some  advantage - whether from the Golden Age, or  forgotten times beyond. The House of Winter's  presence includes constant Skiff overflights in  support of ground teams and hints of an  improvised command post or staging area in the  volcanic Cinders.  The situation is degrading into a race against  time. We must claim the Collective's ruins for our  own - and hope they will warn us what other  threats now rise from Venus' acid seas and ancient  stone.   Ishtar Sink    34  The box appears to be copper.  The red lid is dented, one hinge shattered.  Inside waits a small quantity of the finest, driest powder,  more brown than gray, more blue than green.  The greatest minds in creation make quick work of the  material. The powder is weighed by the grain, and  studied close, and remembered. One hundred billion  bits of near-nothing reside inside the copper box, all of  them tiny and nearly spherical, all etched with the  outlines of continents and islands and icecaps. Each  sphere represents a planet, and some of these tiny  globes match known worlds.  There is one Earth and one Mars and a Venus too.  The box holds renderings of every habitable world in the  galaxy.  One of them offers a simple explanation: "The box is a  message. The message is the minuscule nature of the  box's cargo. It's the image of one hundred billion worlds  barely filling two hands."  But if so, who is delivering this message? What vastness  do they wish to impress on us? Is it a warning, or an  invitation, or a taunt?   Ghost Fragment: Ishtar Sink    His  name  was  Kabr.  He  wasn't  my  friend  but  I  knew  and  respected  him  as  a  Guardian  and  a  good  man.    He  fought  the  Vex  alone.  This  destroyed  him.  In  the  time  before  he  vanished  he  said  things  that  I  think  should  be  remembered.  These  are  some  of  them:    "In  the  Vault  time  frays  and  a  needle  moves  through  it.  The  needle  is  the  will  of  Atheon.  I  do  not  know  the  name  of  the  shape  that  comes  after  the  needle.    No  one  can  open  the  Vault  alone.  I  opened  the  Vault.  There  was  no  one  with  me  but  I  was  not  alone.

Pahanin     Vault  of  Glass        These  are  the  last  words  of  Kabr,  the  Legionless:    I  have  destroyed  myself  to  do  this.  They  have  taken  my  Ghost.  They  are  in  my  blood  and  brain.  But  now     thereishope. I  have  made  a  wound  in  the  Vault.  I  have  pierced  it  and  let  in  the  Light.  Bathe  in  it,  and  be  cleansed.  Look  to  it,  and  understand:    FrommyownLightandfromthethinkingfleshofthe Vex  I  made  a  shield.  The  shield  is  your  deliverance.  It  will  break  the  unbreakable.  It  will  change  your     fate.    Bind  yourself  to  the  shield.  Bind  yourself  to  me.  And  if  you  abandon  your  purpose,  let  the  Vault  consume  you,  as  it  consumed  me.    Now  it  is  done.  If  I  speak  again,  I  am  not  Kabr.     Relic:TheAegis    1.4  MARS     39  MARS  "The wind wiped away our footprints.

I didnï¿½t answer. Not immediately. With Father, every  question was vast, particularly those that looked simple.  And simple questions deserved as much insight and  wisdom as could be brought to bear.  With that in mind, I said nothing.  Why would my father hate maps?  One of his collaborators came into the office. Father  didnï¿½t have employees. Or assistants. And for that matter,  he didnï¿½t have heroes either. Every person, living or lost,  was a collaborator, and that included his children.  ï¿½Clovis,ï¿½ said the visitor.  Father heard the woman, but he was watching me.  The woman was pretty, and I was sixteen. So I looked at  her, smiling enough for both of us. And she threw an  appreciative wink my way as she described test results  from the last five billion runs of our AI Initiative.  Out on the Martian desert, my father and picked  collaborators were building housing too cold for this  universe and too swift to be real.  And I was a sixteen year-old boy smiling at a pretty  woman.  My father thanked her for the update, and she left.  Just as I feared, he never looked away from me.  ï¿½I donï¿½t know why you hate maps,ï¿½ I admitted.  With Father, ignorance was never the worst crime. What  was awful was pretending to have insight and wisdom  where neither existed.  ï¿½Maps end,ï¿½ he said.  I nodded, just a little.     44  ï¿½Maps insist on having borders and edges or the table  falls away. Which isnï¿½t the way the universe works.ï¿½  ï¿½It doesnï¿½t, no,ï¿½ I agreed.  Then he asked me, ï¿½So how does the universe work?ï¿½  I pretended to take my time, considering various smart  answers. But I ended up using my first impulse.  ï¿½Effortlessly,ï¿½ I said.  He laughed. Which wasnï¿½t uncommon for my father, but it  was heartening to hear just then.  ï¿½What else can you tell me?ï¿½ he asked.  ï¿½The universe is infinite and probably in multiple ways,ï¿½ I  said. Then I listed a few examples: The census of stars, the  Many-Worlds principle in quantum mechanics, and the  endless measure of tiny realms hiding inside every grain  of Martian sand.  Father nodded.  The smile died.  Then he said something ominous. Although I didnï¿½t  appreciate it at the time.  ï¿½The universe is someoneï¿½s map,ï¿½ he said.  ï¿½Is it?ï¿½ I muttered.  ï¿½Yes, oh yes. And what weï¿½re doing here... weï¿½re  reaching beyond the boundaries, out into the unknown.  And we pull back new colors to put on this map that  can never, ever let itself be finished.ï¿½  I nodded, smiling like the good son.  But I was sixteen, and my thoughts were mostly about  the pretty woman who had winked at me.

GhostFragment:Mercury 47       50  ASTEROID BELT  "The Belt is the key to everything."  The Asteroid Belt is a great band of nothingness, speckled with unimaginable wealth. Once a treasure  trove for Golden Age industry, the Belt is now a haunted place where Fallen pirates and Awoken patrols  skirmish among the whispering carcasses of ancient machines.  Among the asteroids drifts the Reef, lashed together from the ruined ships of an ancient exodus. Here the  Queen rules over the Awoken - the farthest known light of civilization.   The Asteroid Belt  THE REEF  "Intruder bearing one-two-seven. You have crossed into the realm of the Awoken. State your business, or  be fired upon by order of the Queen."  The fate of those escaping Earth during the Collapse was once unknown. But here drifts a graveyard of  lost ships, and among them - the Realm of the Awoken. Ruled by a Queen few have seen, they have  long avoided contact with the City.   The Reef    51  "And our long-range communications?"  An aggrieved sigh. "Mara, it's a miracle any of us are still aliveï¿½"  "You will address her as 'Queen,'" Techeun Shuro cut in.  "Sorry. My apologies, Queen." The engineer ran a dirty hand  through her matted hair. "No. No long-range comms. No shortrange  comms either. Not that there'd be anyone on the listening  end either, from what I can see. My Queen," she added hastily, as  Shuro glared.  "Comms are no longer a priority," said Mara. "Focus on resealing  the Hulls, and any other habitable vessels we have. Bring anything  you can as close to Vesta as possible. The closer people are to me,  the safer they are."  The engineer nodded uncertainly. "Yes. My Queen."  Mara nodded. "You may go."  The engineer bowed, and left the room. As soon as the hatch  closed behind her, Mara raised her hand. At once the Techeuns  gathered around her. "Shall we try again, My Queen?" said Sedia.  Mara slid off her throne. "Yes."  The Techeuns' jewel-like augments flashed as they circled around her.  Mara closed her eyes. A hum rose from the Techeuns, the notes  fracturing into harmonies as, from the shadows, hundreds of tiny blue  sparks burst to life before her. Then Mara inclined her head, and the  sparks began to rush by as if she was plunging through them, each  streak of blue burning a swath in her vision. As the last spark  vanished, Mara saw darkness once again, a long, stretching, empty  darknessï¿½and then another cloud of sparks burst forth. These were  smaller than the others, their tiny flames guttering and flickering, and  there were fewer of them too, but Mara inhaled and the sparks  rushed toward her, growing bigger as they flew.  "We should have stayed in the Reef..." "...Says there's one city  left..." "A City beneath the Traveler..." "At least we're not in the  Reef..." The voices broke over Mara like a wave and for a moment  she spun in the currents.  Now, in the flames, shapes began to form. A crashed shipï¿½a blueskinned  hand clasping a brown oneï¿½a half-built wall high above the  treetops.  "You who betrayed us for Earth!" Mara thought. "It is I, your Queen!  I will grant you one chance to return, or you will not be welcomed  back!"  But the tide of voices never wavered.

Corsair recon confirms that HVT R3 ships are  resupplying ether and performing high-tempo  logistical operations. Recon elements and  COLLABINT sources agree that Beltrik will roll  one ship at a time into the resupply pocket  while holding all other assets to screen.  2. TF 4.1 will attack. Targets are HVT R3  spaceborne assets. Objective is annihilation  of spaceborne assets and capture/  nullification of HVT R3. Designate targets VEIL  HAND.  2a. Due to history of violence between PLDN  CMD TF 4.1 and HVT R3, particularly Battle  of False Tidings/Hildian Campaign, Beltrik  expects TF 4.1 to engage his screen directly.  We will exploit this expectation. Fragment  orders follow.  3. PETRA VENJ will detach select warships  and air wing elements to form TF 4.2 MASS  LENS. TF 4.2 is directed to engage VEIL  HAND screen elements with skirmishers. TF  4.2 will deny main battle while pinning down  VEIL HAND forces at 19 Fortuna. TF 4.2 will  receive missile and torpedo assets to force  VEIL HAND into maintaining tight mutual  CIWS/ESM support.  3a. Decisive engagement with VEIL HAND  in 4.2 MASS LENS AO is forbidden until  GO CONTINGENCY satisfied. Prioritize  FORCECON.  4. Remaining TF 4.1 will maneuver  immediately to rendezvous with 687 Tinette.  Tinette is on close approach with 19  Fortuna. TF 4.1 frigates and fighters will  perform recon denial against VEIL HAND  scouts.  4a. Upon rendezvous with 687 Tinette, TF  4.1 will deploy CARYBDIS. ***This is a  CARYBDIS RELEASE (MAJESTY DIRECT)!***.  TF 4.1 will maneuver in Tinette's shadow as  it retrajectorizes for intercept.  5. GO CONTINGENCY: Upon collision of  687 Tinette and 19 Fortuna TF 4.1 and TF  4.2 will IMMEDIATELY close for decisive  engagement. VEIL HAND C4I will be  critically degraded and all targets will be  maneuvering away from mutual support.  Skirmishers and air wing will provide  TARCAP and destroy VEIL HAND light  warships as they attempt to reform. EWAR  assets will isolate hostile heavy warships  from C4I and spoof bad datalinks.

He steps through, and the hatch shudders  closed behind him. A series of dim illumination  panels flicker on. He is not alone.  Three dull green lights blaze to life behind a  veil. She tilts her head to consider the Prince,  face like a marble carving.  "You." Her voice resonates inside small  chamber.  "Say what you want and get out. We donï¿½t  have time for this right now."

His arms ached. Two hands wrapped around each bicep like iron  bands. He slumped, and the toes of his scuffed boots bumped over  the stones and left trails in the dust. He kept his eyes low, a ragged  and stained cloak hanging over his face. It was not a position to  which he was accustomed.  They debased him. They abused him. He bit the inside of his cheek  until the blood filled his mouth. He struggled not to resist.  They needed to believe he was broken. That he wasnï¿½t a threat. It  was the only way they would bring him before their kell.  Heï¿½d spent weeks weaving the illusion that led the Fallen to him.  Heï¿½d left bits of his trail where they couldnï¿½t help but find them. He  skulked from planet to planetï¿½Mars, then Venus, then Mercury,  then back againï¿½following rumors and whispers. Heï¿½d hid from  the Guardians, from his own people. Heï¿½d let everything they had  built fall apart, while those still loyal to him searched every inch of  this forsaken system.  Now it was time to stop searching and start building. He would  need soldiers who answered to him and no one else. Bodies to  shape with will and magic and tech to his needs. These would  serve.  He thought they would take him to a ketch. But they were deep  underground. Not near the Cosmodrome, but... it didnï¿½t matter.  Heï¿½d never been particularly concerned with the geography of this  blasted world. It was not his home.  So he bent his head low, and listened to the guttural string of hisses  and clicks issuing from the maw of a would-be king in yellow. A  broken ruler of a broken house, and the last of his kind.  They were more alike than he cared to admit.  When the creatureï¿½s anger had burnt itself out, he raised his head to  look at it. He did not need to speak.  One kell rises, and another bends its knee.  And the prince felt the little hum of starlight ripple through him. The  one that let him know she would be pleased with what he had done.   Ghost fragment: The Reef 4  Vestian Outpost  "Looks like the Queen wants Guardians close... but not too close."  Located on the Reef's sunward side, the Vestian Outpost marks the  flightpath any Guardian must take to access the Queen's realm.  Beyond it lies the Vestian Web, the heart of the Reef built around the  asteroid 4 Vesta.   Vestian Outpost, Queen's Bay    55  Variks the Loyal remembers an ancient time, and an ancient name: the  House of Judgment, when grudges and status fights were worked out  in a safe place. When the berserk and the vengeance-crazed were  kept somewhere harmless, and there were fewer rivals to plot around.  The old Fallen ways align perfectly with the Queen's agenda. With  the House of Wolves in disarray, the Queen needs muscle in the Reef.  Guardians go where the treasure and the glory are, and an arena of  champions is a wonderful place to earn both. Guardians in the Reef  deter threats to the Queen and give the Awoken a chance to learn  about their power and subvert their loyalty to the Traveler. And if, as  the Queen worries, the Nine are scheming against her, then she needs  a good excuse to clear out some of the most dangerous prizes in the  Prison of Elders.  And the Prison of Elders is full of dangerous prizes. The Awoken have  captured titanically dangerous specimens from everywhere in the  inner solar system. These monstrous champions want to smash  Guardian bone and Guardian alloyï¿½and given the chance, they'll kill  Guardians, rend their Ghosts, and snuff them out forever. Walk into  the arena with a Fireteam you trust. And beware: the agents of the  Nine are active in the Reef, and their curiosity is as limitless as it is  inscrutable.  Risk death. Win glory and signs of Her Majesty's favor. But always  remember that you are being watched, and tested.   Prison of Elders    56  Cayde-6, overheard in a Tower lounge  Didn't anyone tell you about the Prison of Elders? Weren't you on the  strike team that killed that Archon Priest, the one who escaped? Okay,  okay, I'll tell the story about the Prison of Elders...  The Awoken will tell you that a long time ago the Queen conquered  the House of Wolves. What they won't say, because they are very  serious important people, is that the House of Wolves did a lot of the  job for them. After the Queen killed the Wolf Kell, the Fallen started  competing for the throne. One of the first battles was called the Eos  Clash and I wasn't anywhere near it, but I'm pretty sure I'm not  making this up. A Fallen named Skolas wiped out one of his rivals in  the Eos Clash. But the battle cost him so much he got to thinking: if the  Reef killed my boss, and gave me a chance at the throne, maybe I can  use the Reef to kill all my rivals too!  Pretty good, right? When they told me I had to be a Vanguard I went  to ask some Fallen how I could get out of it, but they just told me to kill  all my friends and then myself. Anyway.  Everyone involved in the civil war started trying to play their rivals  against each other, and the Awoken too. No one wanted to become  so strong that they'd be a target. No one wanted to bleed their own  forces dry doing someone else's dirty work. Cutthroat politics! And  who's the best at cutthroat politics? That's right, her Majesty, the  Queen of the Reef.  At the end of the wars, the Queen had played her way into the  strongest position, and she had a collection of Fallen nobility and  servitors she thought might be useful to her. Of course she thought so!  She'd just used them against each other and won absolute control of  the Reef, the Belt, and the House of Wolves. She wasn't about to just  toss away her playing pieces.  She kept them frozen in her prison, the Prison of Elders, and she gave  the keys to that prison to my buddy Variks, a Fallen who showed her  loyalty. The Prison of Elders is a really curious thing. It holds creatures  of enormous power. Not just Wolf nobilityï¿½ all kinds of beasts,  captured by Corsair expeditions or lured in by the Queen. And it  holds them well. The Queen, she can do things I don't understand.  There's a power behind her, or in her, that values that Prison.  But I hear there's been a few prison breaks. Some old Kell got the old  House of Wolves back together.  Now, she's started to wake up her captives. Variks is inviting  Guardians out to the Reef to do battle with them in an arenaï¿½show  valor, earn rewards. It's been their Crucible. Maybe the Queen wants  her collection thinned out. Maybe the Queen wants Guardians in the  Reef, to deter more unrest. Maybe the Queen wants intelligence on  how her prizes fight.  Maybe she wants intelligence on how WE fight.  Whatever happensï¿½ I want you to remember that she knows, more  than anyone else I've met, how to set one foe against another.

GhostFragment:Jupiter 58       59  SATURN  Out beyond the Reef its rings shine. Whatever was known of it in the Golden Age is long forgotten, but more  ancient truth remains: Saturn has dozens of moons, including the mighty Titan, a world larger than Mercury. A  Guardian's ship might, in theory, reach Saturn, especially if supported by a larger vessel and good  navigational data. But the hazards of the Reef and the Deep Black beyond threaten to devour anyone who  makes the attempt.   Saturn  Saturn's rings are not solid matter. Comprised of uncountable flecks of ice and dust, and shaped by the gravity  of Saturn and its many moons, these particulates form two glowing rings around the gaseous planet below. Or,  they did. Then Oryx's Dreadnaught arrived. Its weapon punched right through the rings as it rushed toward the  Awoken fleet that stood in its path. The rings of Saturn spin on. Perhaps one day they will be whole again.   Saturn's Rings  Dreams of Alpha Lupi  A cold giant shows its night face to you. Distant moons slide past - icy little comets enslaved by a splendid  master.  The lightning bolts and high clouds sweep away, and you burrow into a sea of liquid hydrogen that boils out  of the long gash.  You put yourself on the perfect trajectory, and for a fraction of an instant you allow yourself the luxury of  confidence.   Ghost Fragment: Saturn    2.0    THE  DARKNESS       64  Dreams of Alpha Lupi  The universe is a beast.  The body is made from tiny stuff, from near-nothings. From atoms swimming through a blood of crackling sparks.  Simple, eternal Laws shape the beast. The largest galaxy is ruled by principles of mass and motion. Electrons are  slaves to charge and to chance. And this is why the universe feels inexhaustible, eternal.  No sun complains about its death. Life is the problem. Life can be woven from flesh or circuit or thoughtful light.  Origins don't matter. But small, half-smart creatures have a fierce talent for denying the inevitable, for balking and  complaining about injustices that don't exist and consequences that should be borne in silence.   Ghost Fragment: Darkness 2  This war is all there is for you.  What else do you have? You walk among mortals and immortals, a creature lost in time. Your only purpose is the  struggle.  Does it seem unfair? To be brought back into this, the end of days, the long dwindling exhalation of an ancient  corpse? You were at peace. Now you are a dead husk charged with war. Do you remember anything of freedom?  Fight on, then. The war IS everything.  But consider the choices before you.   Ghost Fragment: Darkness 4    65  Something hit us. Killed our Golden Age. Nearly wiped us out. Only the  Traveler saved us, and at a shattering cost.  The Speaker tells of a cosmic force that swept over us and caused the  Collapse. Legend calls it the Darkness, the Traveler's ancient enemy,  which hunted it across space.  All we have left are questions. Centuries of debate gave birth to  competing arguments on the nature of the Darkness and the Collapse.  The Pujari Position describes the Darkness as a force with both physical  and moral presence, an actualization of evil. Pujari art depicts the  Darkness as a great storm, or as a change in conduct, a corruption that  emerged from within and poisoned the Golden Age.  Saint-14's Position argues that the Darkness was an invading armada,  an alien force of incredible - but tangible - power. Some adherents  believe that this armada sprang from species rejected or discarded by  the Traveler for their sins.  Ulan-Tan's Thesis considers the Darkness a necessary symmetry to the  Traveler in a cosmic balance. In this view, the Traveler's goodness led it  to sacrifice for others, and it is up to us to return this goodness by  healing the Traveler.  The Monist Position, or the Deflationary Position, considers the Darkness  as a technologically sophisticated force, perhaps a post-Singularity  intelligence. Adherents invoke information theory or contend that the  universe is a simulation, allowing advanced intelligence to gain weakly  acausal powers by bending the rules.  The Acataleptic Clause claims that we are intrinsically unable to  understand the Darkness. In many respects this belief parallels the Praxic  Creed, which suggests that we should stop worrying about the nature of  the Darkness and focus on resisting and defeating it.  Certain positions - often labeled heretical - imply that the Traveler itself  triggered the Collapse, or that it knew the Darkness was coming for it  and hoped to use the Solar System as a sacrifice or a proxy army. The  Binary Star cult is one notable example.   The Darkness  V113NNI070XMX001 SECRET HADAL INSTANT AI-COM/RSPN:  SOLSECCENT//SxISR//DEEPSPACE CONTACT CONTACT  CONTACT TRANSIENT. NULLSOURCE.

Elegant like a knife point. It  explains - this is not hyperbole, this is the  farthest thing from exaggeration -  EVERYTHING.  But you lay it out and they stare at you like  you've just been exhaling dust. Maybe they're  missing some underlying scaffold of truth.  Maybe they are all propped on a bed of lies  that must be burned away.  Why does anything exist?  No no no no no don't reach for that word.  There's no 'reason'. That's teleology and  teleology will stitch your eyelids shut.  Why do we have atoms? Because atomic  matter is more stable than the primordial broth.  Atoms defeated the broth. That was the first  war. There were two ways to be and one of  them won. And everything that came next was  made of atoms.  Atoms made stars. Stars made galaxies.  Worlds simmered down to rock and acid and  in those smoking primal seas the first living  molecule learned to copy itself. All of this  happened by the one law, the blind law,  which exists without mind or meaning. It's the  simplest law but it has no worshippers here  (out there, though, out there - !)  HOW DO I EXPLAIN IT it's so simple WHY  DON'T YOU SEE  Imagine three great nations under three great  queens. The first queen writes a great book of  law and her rule is just. The second queen  builds a high tower and her people climb it to  see the stars. The third queen raises an army  and conquers everything.  The future belongs to one of these queens. Her  rule is harshest and her people are unhappy.  But she rules.  This explains everything, understand? This is  why the universe is the way it is, and not some  other way. Existence is a game that everything  plays, and some strategies are winners: the  ability to exist, to shape existence, to remake it  so that your descendants - molecules or stars  or people or ideas - will flourish, and others  will find no ground to grow.  And as the universe ticks on towards the close,  the great players will face each other. In the  next round there will be three queens and all  of them will have armies, and now it will be a  battle of swords - until one discovers the  cannon, or the plague, or the killing word.  Everything is becoming more ruthless and in  the end only the most ruthless will remain  (LOOK UP AT THE SKY) and they will hunt the  territories of the night and extinguish the first  glint of competition before it can even  understand what it faces or why it has  transgressed. This is the shape of victory: to  rule the universe so absolutely that nothing will  ever exist except by your consent. This is the  queen at the end of time, whose sovereignty is  eternal because no other sovereign can defeat  it. And there is no reason for it, no more than  there was reason for the victory of the atom. It  is simply the winning play.  Of course, it might be that there was another  country, with other queens, and in this country  they sat down together and made one law and  one tower and one army to guard their  borders. This is the dream of small minds: a  gentle place ringed in spears.  But I do not think those spears will hold  against the queen of the country of armies.  And that is all that will matter in the end.

They name us Fallen.  Listen to me, Wolf-born! Heed me, Whirlwindscattered!  I am the ghost of Cybele, the  cunning claw of Iris, betrayed, chained,  encrypted by the Queen, sent back from the  Darkness to save us all! The days of Kell and  House end now. The calendar of slavery and  abasement goes to the fire. We are a new  calendar! We are an age of beginnings!  Each of us is a day!  I am the first, Kell of Kells, and I am the last,  the Dreg of Dregs. I have conquered and  been conquered. I am all of us and all of us  are I. In the shape of my life I bind up all of  us, all of our fury, all of our grief, all the lives  we have wasted against each other. Together  we speak our new name.  Remember the hope that brought us here.  Remember the age before the Whirlwind,  when ether ran free, when we ruled ourselves  and our futures as kings. We wanted more  than glimmer and glints and herealways.  Always remember that we came to this star in  hope. And remember that we were denied!  Remember the City of the Death of Children,  the City That Docks, which claimed for itself  the Great Machine that might have saved us.  Remember the City that even now sends its  ghouls to murder our Primes, starve our ether,  and leave our young to die gasping. Curse  that City and its name. The curse is just.  We gathered to take that City and save  ourselves from extinction, saying to each  other, we must be a storm, a Whirlwind, a  darkness, for it is said that only pain may be  stolen from the dark, and we can let no more  be stolen from us. We gathered to fight  against our twilight, King and Devil and  Winter, all of us but us, the Wolves. Why?  What kept us from the Gap?  The Reef. The Queen. The slavers who  played us against each other and docked us  into subservience. These sly sterile un-people,  these mirages with cold minds twinned to  their own, these Carybdis butchers, they set  us against each other. She played us. She  made herself our Kell.  We were fools, o children of the Whirlwind.  We fought each other when we most needed  unity. I fought my rivals when I should have  fought the Queen. But I remember now, my  dregs, my captains, my Kells, each of us is  all of us and I remember: we are a people of  resilience. I am the Kell of Kells because I  want what we have lost. I am the Dreg of  Dregs because I remember that a dreg will  grow back what is lost to him. Ask them my  name! Ask them with the shock blade and  the shrapnel launcher!

Ask them our name. Let them answer: you  are Skolas, Kell of Kells. You are Fallen  no more.   Ghost Fragment: Fallen 3    72  Cayde-6 Reminisces  Okay, okay, I'll tell the story about that one  Fallen.  It didn't happen like that. We didn't, you  know, do anything actively - no handshake,  no icy stare of grudging mutual respect. I  don't even know which hand you would  shake. Do they shake hands? It must be  complicated.  Anyway, it was like this. I was on the  Moon. I cracked a Hive structure near  Mare Imbrium, looking for a Shrine, and  they just - swarmed. Ranks and ranks and  ranks of Thrall, pouring out between the  columns, but the columns were Knights,  and all the shadows behind them rose up  hissing sorcery.  Of course I ran.  I had a line of egress and while yes it was  full of Thrall I had a backup too. I went  upslope. Took cover in the shadow of a  crashed Phaeton. Emptied my machine  gun, ducked down to reload, and saw her at  the other end of the hull, killing Thrall: a  Fallen in Exile colors, bannered in the marks  of a Baron, though the flags were claw-torn  and stained with Hive ash. She was alone. I  think she must have lost her crew.  I didn't really have time to shoot her and she  didn't really have time to shoot me so we just  went back to killing Hive. Knights pushed me  out into the open and back up the range to a  high stone saddle in the shadow of an old  interferometry array. It was good ground so  she came up there too.  For a while we just killed things which is  hard to make interesting in a story so I'll pass  it over.  At the end the Wizards came. I climbed the  array to get an angle on them and she fell  back to the base of the antennae where she  broke her swords off in a Knight. I saw that  happen and I don't know if I can tell you  how I felt. She was another living thing with  a mind I could understand and she hadn't  howled at me or tried to eat my Ghost. I  cheered when the Knight went down.  When I came down, empty on all guns, she  was slumped against a bulkhead staring at  me with all her tiny black eyes. Ether leaking  out of her like smoke. The Knight hadn't died  easily. Downslope the last Wizard moved  like fire behind another line of Thrall.  I looked at her and wondered how many  innocent human lives she'd ended on those  broken blades.  She did the strangest thing then. Took the last  shock pistol from her bandolier and threw it  between us, as if to offer it. When I went to  pick it up she tried to knife me, but she was  slow, and when I broke her arms and  opened her throat she didn't seem surprised.  To this day I wonder if she hated me, or  wanted to make me kill her, or just felt she  should spare me the choice.  I did kill a few Thrall with that pistol.

Ceres rules the Asteroid Belt. Ceres is the  white queen of this space, four hundred  million kilometers from the Sun. Ceres is  round. Round means power, out here:  nothing else in the Belt is big enough to  crush itself into a sphere with its own gravity.  Ceres has its own chemical stars. Shavings  of salt and ice that glint in orbit. Like a  crown.  There are other lights, newer stars, newer  crowns. Warship engines. Another queen is  coming to conquer Ceres, because Ceres is  full of warrens and shipyards and habitats,  because Ceres is round and lucky as a  Servitor. Because Ceres is full of the Wolves  she wants to rule.  Shark-fierce ships gather in squadrons and  tribes. Skiffs. Ketches. The Kell of Wolves  has a fleet gathered here. The Kell of Wolves  heard the call, and summoned the House of  Wolves to prepare for the great battle on  Earth. The salvation of the Kell's people  depends on their ability to shatter the City.  It's a matter of survival.  Now the Wolf fleet turns to meet the Queen.  See the squadrons of Skiffs wrapping  themselves in stealth, cold and transparent,  knifing out invisible and brave? See the  Ketches like broad blades, the bright  thoughts of a Servitor guiding them to battle?  See them turning, accelerating, waking up  their jammers and their arc guns? All  doomed. The Kell of Wolves will never  make it to the Twilight Gap. The Kell of  Wolves put all that strength in one place,  and now the Queen of the Reef is coming  to break it.  Out there, coming out of the dark, are the  Awoken. Not so great a fleet, is it? Little  fighters scattered around like four-pointed  thorns. Destroyers and frigates and  salvaged hulls pulled out of the Reef. And  right at the front, at the speartip, flies the  Queen.  The Wolf Kell, practical, brave, tallies  strength of metal and equipment. The Kell  considers the chance that the Awoken have  some secret weapon, something gleaned  from hulks in the Reef or whispered up by  the witches, and sets that chance aside. The  Kell thinks the House of Wolves can win  decisively. So the Kell sends challenge and  warning. I AM LORD OF WOLVES, the Kell  sends. YOU ARE AN EMPTY THING WITH  TWO DEAD SOULS. THIS IS MY HOUSE.  THESE ARE MY TERMS. SURRENDER AND  I WILL ONLY TAKE YOUR SHIPS.  The Awoken fleet cuts their engines. Drifts.  Wolf strike elements, torpedo-armed Skiffs  hidden under jamming and camouflage,  find their firing solutions.  The Queen's ship broadcasts. I AM NOBLE  TOO, she says, OH LORD OF WOLVES.  The Kell doesn't mind a little banter before  the kill. It gives the Wolf ships longer to draw  the battle away from Ceres. The Kell replies.  YOU HAVE NO LINE. YOU HAVE NO  POWER. Captains and Barons signal their  readiness, Skolas and Pirsis and Irxis, Drevis,  Peekis, Parixas, all of them bound by fear  and loyalty, all ready for war.  STARLIGHT WAS MY MOTHER. The Queen's  ship whispers in eerie erratic radio bursts.  Servitors begin to report a strange taste in  the void. AND MY FATHER WAS THE DARK.  Here, at last, too late, the Kell begins to feel  fear. CALL ON THEM, THEN, the Kell sends,  one last mocking signal before death and  ruin, AND SEE WHAT HELP THEY OFFER.  So the Queen calls, as only she can. Every  Servitor in every Ketch hears it. Every  Captain and Baron roars at their underlings  as sensors go blind, as firing solutions falter,  as reactors stutter and power systems hum  with induction. Stealth fails. Space warps.  The House of Wolves shouts in spikes of warcode,  maneuvers wild, fires blind.  Behind the Queen's ship, the Harbingers  awaken.   Ghost Fragment: Fallen 4    75  Frozen on the monitor was an image of  Sepiks Prime, the massive Prime  Servitor that had been as a god to the  House of Devils. Where once its plating  was pristine, carefully maintained by  the Archon Priest and his acolytes, it  was now splotched with red growths.  The ether power emanations that once  glowed strong and pure were obviously  corrupted.  Guardians had slain this god. And now  it was reborn, through SIVA.  Variks of House Judgment sneered at  the abomination. ï¿½Golden Age project,  yes?ï¿½ he clicked, turning to the Crow.  His field agent was a young Awoken  woman. ï¿½Technology of old Earth.  Learned from the Great Machine.ï¿½  The Eliksni burbled to himself in  mocking laughter and gestured with his  lower hands. ï¿½You do us proud. Go.  Speak with other Crows, learn more  about these... Devil Splicers.ï¿½ She  nodded, a small smile on her face, and  left the chamber.  Variks allowed himself a moment of  silent contemplation, looking at the  now-closed door to the information  suite. As always, it was lit only by the  light of the dozen or so monitors in the  room.  The Fallen interlocked his upper hands.  He bowed his head as he allowed  himself to really feel the impact of that  abomination on the screen. He never  would have allowed anyone else to see  this, but it hurt. Seeing the horror that was  ï¿½Sepiksï¿½ made anew.  His people had fallen.  Variks stared at the image of Sepiks. And  as heï¿½d done before, he wondered what  would have gone differently had he been  there, among his people. Could he have  stopped this before it happened? Could he  have found them a better way?  ï¿½Must be a better way for Eliksni.ï¿½ He  clicked quietly. ï¿½Must be a way to stop the  Fall.ï¿½   Ghost Fragment: Fallen 5     76  THETA// NINE // SEVEN // RED // DELTA High  Priority Message ï¿½ Commanderï¿½s Terminal EYES  ONLY // TWILIGHT PROTOCOL ï¿½-  Recon groups A, J, and T returned to TOWER  ACTUAL at 03:00 local time.  No casualties. Light injuries across multiple members  of J and T teams.  Full debrief to follow.  ï¿½-  Breaking mission topsheet protocol, Commander. I  want you to understand the scope of what weï¿½re  looking at here.  As the fireteams fanned out across the region, the  Devils rushed to meet them. Our forces dealt with  some post-SIVA pockets of Splicer activity, and every  once in a while the Kings popped their heads up and  scared the hell out of everyone. In other words:  situation absolutely normal.  Thatï¿½s a lie. The Fallen are abandoning the  Cosmodrome.  Hawk fly-overs confirm. The House of Devils forces  are simply not there anymore. Theyï¿½ve been  disorganized for the last few years, but thereï¿½s never  been a shortage of ground troops whenever we  staged a significant sortie.  Intel source GREENRAVEN was right. And, for the  moment, itï¿½s worth assuming their report on the  House of Exiles, House of Winter, and House of  Wolves are also accurate. Weï¿½re fact-checking  against independent fireteam reports from the field.  The kid all the SRL fans talk about ï¿½ Marcus? He  was in one of the fireteams out at the Cosmodrome.  He pulled me aside, and said it to me straight: the  Fallen Houses are gone. The siege is broken. The  stalemate weï¿½ve had with the Eliksni for what, a  hundred years? Itï¿½s over. We won.  Commander, Iï¿½m not even sure theyï¿½re flying the  banners anymore. The teams found huge mounds  of burnt cloth and armor, ceremonial piles, in  several of the most hardcore Fallen holdouts.  Whatï¿½s changed? Where have the Fallen gone?  Why have they burned their banners?  Iï¿½m drawing up a plan to coordinate forces from  the Queenï¿½s Wrath, Felwinter Peak, the Warlock  Orders, and more non-traditional outfits to follow  up on these reports.  I believe your wisdom will guide us through the  trials ahead.  ï¿½Sloane   Ghost Fragment: Fallen 6    3.23.2 FALLEN  COMBAT        78  Captain  "Waves of them smashed against our walls, hissing and wailing. But it was the  one who stood beyond them, silent and scenting the air, that froze the blood in  our veins."  Having clawed and knifed his way to the top, scattering bodies and limbs in his  wake, the Captain is the strongest and most ferocious member of the crew he  musters around himself. His ration of Ether is the largest, his blades the sharpest,  his guns the finest. Upon his shoulders hangs the flag of his House, if he swears  loyalty to any. For his crew, the slightest hesitation to comply earns a slash from his  sword. Defiance results in immediate amputation, if he is in a good mood, or  death, if he is not.   Captain  Servitor  "A floating light, a sleepless eye. Their hope, their faith, their sustenance."  Servitors are living relics of the once-mighty Fallen civilization. Packed with  ultra-sophisticated machinery, they process matter and energy into the Ether  that the Fallen depend on for life. In battle they support the Fallen with  defensive systems and their own powerful energy weapons. Outside, they  anchor Fallen comms and provide vital technological acumen.  Servitors have complex relationships with each other and with their Fallen  crews. Servitors are attached to a Prime, a massive Servitor which exists in  unclear symbiosis with a Fallen Archon. The Archon conveys the Kell's  wishes to the Prime Servitor, and exerts some measure of control. Recent  developments suggest that Prime Servitors are more than a focus of worship  and logistical activity. They may play a key role in Fallen star flight.  Servitor  FALLEN RANKS     79  Dreg  "Don't underestimate a cutthroat, or you'll get your throat cut."  Dregs cling to the lowest rung of Fallen society. Docked of their lower arms  in a ritual of humiliation and obedience, Dregs seek to prove their worth.  Only a few will survive to gain promotion and regrow their limbs. Their  suicidal bravery is fueled by ambition and shame.   Dreg  Shank  "Death flies on tarnished wings."  Shanks are the bulldogs of the Fallen. Small and tough enough to go where  Dregs won't fit, they scout, keep watch, and patrol. Fallen Walkers deploy  Shanks from internal bays for tactical support and field repairs.   Shank  Vandal  "You could drown the City in the blood they've spilt."  Soldiers, brawlers, assassins, and scouts, Vandals are  the seasoned regulars who fill out the skilled roles  within a Fallen crew. Whether from distance or up  close and personal, they are seasoned, efficient killers,  with an arsenal of weaponry and tech to match their  bloodlust.   Vandal    80  THE FALLEN HOUSES  HOUSE OF DEVILS  "The Devils take whatever nature has yet to claim." - Master Rahool  These are the scourge of the City, the shadow below our walls. This is the  House that led the battle at the Twilight Gap, the House we tell our children  about to frighten them into behaving.  The House of Devils have now devoted great strength to pillaging the  Cosmodrome in Old Russia, hunting for something buried below. If they are  not held in check, whatever they find might prove the City's undoing.   House of Devils  HOUSE OF EXILE  "They live among the Hive. Of course they're crazy." - Cayde-6  There is more than a whiff of desolation about these Fallen. Their ranks are  swollen with Dregs; their rags threadbare. Perhaps this is a new House,  gathered from the outcast malcontents and disgraced castaways of the  others, galvanized by pride or hate or the desire for freedom.  Be watchful. If this is true, they will surely be hungry to secure their position -  and that may drive them to bold action   House of Exile    81  HOUSE OF WINTER  "Their greed is as much a threat as their blades." - Commander Zavala  The Fallen House of Winter, led by the ruthless Kell Draksis, have been  found operating in and around the Ishtar Sink on Venus. Their interests there  seem directed at the ruins of the Academy along the Shattered Coast, but  there are concerns that their focus may, in actuality, be directed elsewhere -  toward the ominous Citadel that rises like a warning above the Waking  Ruins.   House of Winter  HOUSE OF WOLVES  "These ones are mine." - The Queen  The bulk of the House of Wolves now falls under the control of the Queen of  the Reef. There are many stories of how this came to be, but they are too  varied for the truth to be separated from rumor.   House of Wolves  HOUSE OF KINGS  "Another great House hides among us..." - Ikora Rey  The colors of the House of Kings are rarely seen. They  act with brutal contempt, as if they hold their rivals -  other Fallen and City alike - in disdain. We have yet  to grasp the full measure of their strength.   House of Kings    82  Shock Pistol  The Shock Pistol is a simple but deadly weapon, and a mainstay of the  Fallen arsenal. Primarily utilized by the lower ranking members of a given  Fallen crew, Shock Pistols discharge bolts of Arc energy.   Shock Pistol  Shock Rifle  Although based on the same Arc technology as other  Fallen weaponry, this rifle has a distinct advantage: the  projectiles it fires track unerringly to the target. The  exact mechanism behind this is unclear, but the rifle  seems to steer the slow-moving molten projectile down  an artificial field line.   Shock Rifle  Shrapnel Launcher  The Shrapnel Launcher is a simple, effective, robust weapons system that the  Fallen can build without risking vital resources. The weapon fires looseforged  canisters of explosives and shrapnel down electromagnetic rails  embedded in the barrel. Captains favor this weapon for its intimidating  presence. It deals Solar damage.   Shrapnel Launcher  FALLEN WEAPONRY     83  Wire Rifle  The Wire Rifle utilizes shock cores to charge thin wires of an exotic metal,  converting them into Arc-infused molten shards with an extraordinary muzzle  velocity.   Wire Rifle  Shock Dagger  The Shock Dagger is a deadly combination of stun gun  and knife. Composed of a lightweight metal and  powered by a small Arc charge, the Shock Dagger is  capable of cutting through armor and delivering a  staggering jolt of electricity. The Fallen use them for  every purpose imaginable, from light metalwork to  hand-to-hand combat.   Shock Dagger  Shock Blade  These full-length edged weapons gather Arc energy from a system of shock  cores and charging caps in the hilt, converting the entire length of the blade  into a plasma cutting torch. Brutally efficient in the hands of a skilled  Captain, Shock Blades are not ceremonial weapons built for show.  Guardians would do well to respect the threat they present.   Shock Blade    Shock  Grenade    The  Shock  Grenade  is  a  simple,  effective  Fallen  weapon.  The  core  of  the  device  is  a  shock  core  encased  in  an  induction  motor.  Once  activated,  an    Arcchargebuildsinthecoreuntilitreachescriticalmass,startingachainreactionthatendswithadevastatingexplosion.  Shock  Grenade    Web  Mine    The  Fallen  have  a  variety  of  tricks  up  their  many  sleeves.  The  Web  Mine  is    proximityorimpacttriggeredsnaredevicethatreleasesatangleof"heavy" arc  energy,  causing  spatial  disruption  within  its  sphere  of  influence.  The  Web  Mine's  triggering  mechanism  ejects  the  physical  mine  into  the  air  where  it  detonates  its  "Web"  field.  The  triggering  mechanism  and  mine  can    bothbedestroyedwithfocusedfire.  Web  Mine     84       85  Scorch Cannon  Scorch Cannons are shoulder-mounted heavy impact weapons used by the Fallen for hullpuncturing  in ship-to-ship raiding parties. The Scorch Cannon uses a compressed Solar  "furnace" to focus and direct superheated rods of solar energy. Each burst is mapped to the  Cannon's firing matrix, allowing the wielder to hold a fired rod's charge. Release of the firing  actuator triggers detonation. The longer the actuator is held the greater the rod's explosive  impact.   Scorch Cannon  Shock Cannon  Aimed from the shoulder, the Arc spike in this Fallen  Cannon can smash a Sparrow in a single shot. Once  lodged, the spike can be charged for several seconds,  to destructive effect.   Shock Cannon  Null Cannon  Fallen Splicers have been busy playing with what theyï¿½ve looted from the  Hive. A spike of Void energy binds to the heavy Cannon scaffold for a  powerful charge-and-detonate missile.   Null Cannon    86  Skiff  Slipping out of stealth only to offload a crew of Fallen, the Skiff is rarely  seen. On the other hand, its rumbling, booming arrival is difficult to miss - as  are the weapons it uses to support its troop deployments.   Skiff  Fallen Walker  Fallen Walkers are mobile gun platforms deployed in offensive and  defensive roles alike. Though their insect-like design gives them an eerie,  almost lifelike quality, these heavily-armored monstrosities are purely robotic.  Their advanced tracking systems can account for multiple targets as their  forward repeaters and massive main gun sweep the battlefield for threats.  Mine dispensers provide close defense against dismounted infantry, and an  on-board Shank foundry produces armed repair drones.  Walkers are immediate and deadly threats, having ended the Light of  countless Guardians. The Fallen do not hesitate to deploy them to provide  overwatch for their salvage and extraction crews. Walkers are also  commonly used as blocking forces to guard key Fallen assets. At the Battle  of Twilight Gap, Walkers engaged in a thunderous artillery duel with the  City's gun positions.  The collected wisdom of battle-hardened Guardians suggests Walkers can  FALLEN VEHICLES  be beaten by focusing fire on the legs, overloading the  Walker and rendering its armored core briefly  vulnerable. When the Walker stumbles, Guardians  should focus all available firepower on the exposed  components beneath the neck plating. Some externally  mounted weapons can also be disabled with precise  fire.   Walker    Pike    A  Pike  looks  and  sounds  like  rusted  junk  but  moves  like  a  shark.  Lightning    cracklesintheengine,whichcanacceleratetofantasticspeed.Twinguns mow  down  infantry.  The  Fallen  deploy  Pikes  as  high-speed  harassers  and    patrolvehicles.  Pike    HeavyPiHkekeavyPie The  Heavy  Pike  is  a  Fallen  combat  and  demolitions  vehicle.  Unlike  the  standard  assault  Pike,  the  weightier  Heavy  Pikes  are  equipped  with  high- caliber  twin-nose  cannons  and  dual  expel  ports  to  either  side  that  launch  explosive  devices.  Heavy  Pikes  should  be  considered  a  clear  and  definite  danger  when  encountered  in  the  wilds.  However,  should  a  Guardian,  or  Guardians,  find  occasion  to  utilize  the  Heavy  Pike  to  their  own  ends,  such     behaviorishighlyencouraged.  HeavyPike 87        3.3  FALLEN  LEADERSHIP     89  Riksis, Devil Archon  "The Archons are the links between the Fallen and their Servitors. We break those  links, we break the Fallen."  Archons are revered amongst the Fallen. It is unknown whether these high priests  are the caretakers of the Prime Servitors, or simply vicious arbiters of the Primes'  will.  Riksis collects the skulls of dead Guardians. Whether he keeps them as trophies or  presents them as offerings to whatever Prime he serves, his threat is very real, and  his death will bring great joy to a City in need of hope.   Riksis, Devil Archon  Simiks-3  "Its thirst for knowledge was left unquenched for so long, its death will almost be  considered a tragedy."  Simiks-3 was born of Winter's Prime Servitor, rumored to have been destroyed  long ago. From readings gathered during the battle, it appears Simiks-3 was  uniquely equipped to process and store huge amounts of intel between itself and  a chain of nearby Servitors.   Simiks-3    90  Draksis, Winter Kell  "The architect of Winter's strategy. And he still shows his strength on the front  line." - Commander Zavala  Draksis, Kell of the Wintership Simiks-fel, has been an elusive target for the  Vanguards. After his countless raids on jumpship reclamation convoys, Cayde-6  personally upped the bounty on him. With confirmed sightings of the Kell in the  Ishtar Sink, the time to strike is now.  Defeating Draksis could throw Winter into chaos. With Simiks Prime allegedly  already lost, the House leadership would be gutted - although proof of the  Servitor's demise remains elusive.   Draksis, Winter Kell  Sepiks Prime  "I never believed a machine could know hatred."  Floating, emotionless arbiters of life and death, Servitors are quasi-religious automata  defended by the Fallen with zealous ferocity.  The exalted Servitor of the Fallen House of Devils, Sepiks Prime, has long been rumored to  dwell deep within the bowels of the Cosmodrome. While the Kells are the political leaders  of the Fallen, Servitors are said to be their gods - and the source of their life-sustaining ether.  A Prime Servitor is a target worthy of even the greatest sacrifice. Those willing to accept  such a challenge will have the eternal gratitude of a City desperate for relief.  Sepiks Prime relies on fanatical reinforcements and its own considerable tactical abilities -  including a short-range teleport and a powerful directed energy weapon. Aim for the eye,  and break contact if it turns your way.   Sepiks Prime    91  Aksor, Archon Priest  A disciple of the Prime Servitor Kaliks, Aksor initiated brutal crusades  against human settlements beyond the City and ravaged countless Awoken  enclaves throughout the Reef. When the Queen waged her war against the  Wolves, Aksor was taken alive and sealed into the infamous Prison of  Elders.  Killing Aksor before he can join the ranks of the House of Winter weakens  the Fallen, strengthens ties to the Reef, and brings the City one step closer to  gaining a solid foothold along the Shattered Coast.   Aksor, Archon Priest  The Silent Fang  Commanded by the fearsome Drevis, Wolf Baroness, the Silent Fang are a unit of  elite stealth warriors and assassins. Instrumental in Skolas' rise to kellship among the  Wolves, the Silent Fang also menaced the Queen during the Reef War. It was Drevis  and the Silent Fang who razed Amethyst, and then tricked the Queen's Armada at  the Battle of Iris. Though the Silent Fang suffered a serious blow when Drevis was  finally thrown in the Prison of Elders after the Siege of Pallas, they continued to  threaten the Queen's forces until the war's end.   The Silent Fang    92  Paskin, King Baron  Hall of Crows  Prince Uldren: Look at it from the House of Kings' perspective. Their  power is matched only by their cleverness. They rule the Devils from the  shadows and came too close to toppling the City not once, but twice.  We don't know much about them, but we know this: the Kings want the  Traveler.  So why would they give it all up just because some outsystem Wolf runs  in calling himself Kell of Kells?  The answer is: they wouldn't.  Petra Venj: But what if Skolas could somehow prove to them that he's  the prophesied leader? Some artifact, or trick?  Yasmin Eld: Perhaps a new power, even.  Prince Uldren: No. Short of the Traveler itself calling Skolas by name,  the Kings would not just roll over for anyone, no matter what. They're  too ambitious.  Petra Venj: You sound like you admire them.  Prince Uldren: Power cleverly deployed is always worth admiring.  Yasmin Eld: So why send the King Barons?   Paskin, King Barron    93  Yavek, Wolf Baron  "Serve him; he is Kell of Kells."  Yavek was a minor lieutenant of Skolas' during the Reef Wars who  evaded capture after the Cybele Uprising. After Skolas returned to the  House of Wolves, he named Yavek a Baron to reward his loyalty, and  sent him to Earth to be his negotiator with the Houses of Kings and  Devils.   Yavek, Wolf Baron  Vekis, King Baron  Hull of Crows  Prince Uldren: Of the Kell of Kings, we know nothing. Wherever, whoever it is, it  remains hidden, even when the so-called Kell of Kells comes to its borders. Instead, it  sends just two Barons: Paskin and Vekis.  Yasmin Eld: What do we have on them?  Petra Venj: Should I issue bounties on them?  Prince Uldren: No, you do not see. Perhaps if we wait, Paskin and Vekis will do our  work for us.  Yasmin Eld: You believe Paskin and Vekis are not ambassadors?  Prince Uldren: I am sure of it.  Shuro Chi: Be certain, my prince, that your assessment is free of personal bias.  Prince Uldren: What are you suggesting, Shuro?   Vekis, King Baron    94  Taniks, The Scarred  ï¿½It is the lone wolf, once cornered, who has the worst bite.ï¿½  Taniks, the Scarred, a mercenary known for the theft of Aksor from  the Prison of Elders and the murder of Hunter Vanguard Andal Brask,  sells his services to any Fallen House willing to pay the right price. It  is believed by the Fallen that he is undying, a living huntsman whose  physical self is joined with a mix of technologies, each pilfered from  legendary treasure troves. But treasure is not the only currency of  value to Taniks. His true ambitions rest in the challenge of the feats in  front of him, and the rewards simply allow him to exist free of any  Kellï¿½s rule.   Taniks, The Scarred  Pilot Servitors  "Pilots once mapped the stars. Skolas turned them into weapons."  Pilot Servitors were not typically utilized as combatants in Fallen battle  plans. Their purpose was manning the flight of various Fallen ships, from  crew transports to massive war-barges.  During the Reef Wars, however, Skolas crafted brutal new tactics to inflict  maximum destruction upon the Awoken, including suicide attacks led by  Pilot Servitors.  With the wounds of the Reef Wars renewed by the House of Wolves'  betrayal, the Queen no longer abides their presence in her Reef.   Pilot Servitor    95  Kaliks Reborn  "This machine is no God... But given fervent worship even a shell  can transcend."  Kit-bashed using parts and pieces of lesser Servitors, Kaliks  Reborn is fueled by servants so loyal to the rule of the long-lost  Kaliks Prime that they would sacrifice their own ether to the last  fume.  Kaliks Reborn is seen by these devout prisoners as the resurrection  of their Prime. With a Kaliks to serve, the Fallen may rally, the  Wolves may gain new strength. Or worse, a new House may rise  ï¿½a House blinded by faith and hungry to be seen as equal.   Kaliks Reborn  S.A.B.E.R. -2  ï¿½If the Devils ever gain control of Rasputinï¿½s Warsats, we'd have Golden  Age ordnance pointed at the Tower in minutes.ï¿½  Reports show this vastly modified Shank and its defense armaments are  enough to force the Vanguard to strike, but it is the tech underneath its  layers of armor, cobbled together from Cosmodrome debris and  cannibalized Servitor parts that is most concerning. All intel points to  modifications made specially by rising Archons to breach the Warmind's  firewalls and seize control of its systems.   S.A.B.E.R. -2    96  Variks keeps a ragged piece of armor in his pod. It's human tech,  Golden Age. Shattered in some ancient battle, pre-Collapse, and left  to drift. He found it and he brought it to his quarters so he could sit on  it. It's nothing like a throne. Variks doesn't want a throne.  He sits on his ancient shrapnel, unmasked, and whittles at an  amethyst with the dead edge of a shock dagger. Music plays  (something ancient, pre-Whirlwind, beautiful). The ether in the air is  rich and it fills him up with strength. Skolas has been captured, mad  Skolas who would have ruined everything. Variks should be happy.  He's not. With his little knife and his two arms and his stolen shining  thing he feels like a Dreg. He feels ashamed.  He betrayed Skolas twice. At Cybele, and again, now. He will betray  Skolas' dream ten times more. Variks will never be strong like Skolas,  big like Skolas, a leader like Skolas. Variks will work for the Queen,  oversee the Prisons, watch his fellow Fallen (they are Fallen, it's a  good name now) fight and die as gladiators who want nothing except  a chance to hurt Guardians. Even Skolas.  He tried to use the Vex, word has it. He tried to use their machines.  Has that ever worked for anyone? Maybe one. Maybe a few: the  Osiris cultists are Variks' favorite people. Maybe that's how you  survive this alien star where dead gods slumber and dead heroes  walk. You cozy up to powers you barely understand and make  yourself useful, or at least inoffensive. You become a parasite, a  scavenger, a servant.  That's dreg strength. That's the strength that keeps Variks alive. It's  nothing to be ashamed of.   Skolas Captured  Skolas, Kell of KellSkolas, Kells   Author's Note: Skolas' escape from the Queen of the  reef started one of the widest searches of the solar system  since the collapse, it was what opended up the reef for the  guardians... In the following pages are records of Skolas  during the hunt.  In this time, Warlock scholars were able to aquire a partial  record of the Mariad, a series of awoken recordings from  the Reef Wars which occured at a time when the city was  only young.      97 people, the House of Judgment that once kept codes of dignity  and law?  Why can't the Fallen have that strength? But no, that strength is  not for them, not for Variks. Just this bleeding, sad pragmatism.  Just dreg strength. Hanging on.  The alternative is Skolas' strength, fighting together, raging  against extinction. Look where that's gotten the species. The  House of Devils' Prime is dead. The House of Winter's leadership  devastated. The poor Exiles trying to claw out some security  against the Hive. In the last few years the Fallen have lost so  muchï¿½and everything is escalating around them. There are gods  and powers converging on this system, old machines waking up,  old bones whispering flatteries. They need a new way.  "Put your mask on," Petra says. "The Prince gets sullen if he's  kept waiting."  "Not like us," Variks says, oh so mild. The wound on his hand  will heal. His work in the Prison of Elders, setting up trial by  combat, building an audience and a relationship with the Reef's  scavengers and armories, will bring him a little closer towards  rebuilding the House of Judgment. Skolas' fury has guttered out.  The Fallen may yet accept peaceful, lawful rule. They may yet  survive. They'll hang on. "We're very patient, yes?"  Petra looks down on him with pity and contempt and a strange  fondness. He puts on his mask.   Skolas Defeated  Skolas is dead.  Variks sits carving at his piece of amethyst. His undocked arms  are weaker, less precise, but it is a comfort to feel the crystal  press hard into his palm. The knife slips. He cuts himself. "Ai," he  says, and of course right then the door opens, Variks has no  privacy, Variks wants no privacy, Variks lives to serve the Queen.  It's Petra Venj. She's masked against the ether air. "The Prince  wants to speak," she says, and then, seeing him unmasked and  bleeding, she chuckles. Petra depends on Variks for intelligence  and Variks, frustrated with her insane risk-taking and bravado,  sometimes gives her tips meant to get her killed. Petra has figured  this out. Petra and Variks know each other's agendas and each  other's strengths and to Variks that's as close as any two people  can get. Petra is smart: she sends Guardians now, people who  can die as much as they like.  "You slipped," she says.  Variks holds up the amethyst in his bleeding hand. It's a Reef  gem. "I wound myself," he says, "to make this more beautiful."  She stares into the gem with a distant Awoken eye. What does  she see? Variks knows she has visions and he knows those visions  haunt her, drive her. The Awoken are twinned to powers that  terrify Variks. He'd dock himself again before he'd let the Queen's  witches near him, the witches who raised Petra.  The unfairness of it makes him want to roar. Why does everyone  else have this patronage? Why do the Hive have gods and the  Vex have sprawling time-bent minds and the Cabal have  reinforcements? Why do the Awoken whisper to the stars and  listen for the whisper back, the voices from the Jovians, the song  in the dark? Why do the Guardians get the Great Machine's  blessing, was it like that before the Whirlwind, were there Fallen  heroes crowned in Ghosts who strode the battlefield fearless and  full of Light? Why do they tell stories about reclaiming the lost  glory of humanity, and no stories about the lost glory of Variks'    98       99  The Maraid, Book VII, Chapter 10  Abstract: The transmission was broadcasted on all  Fallen frequencies. Lacking, at the time, the ability to  crack Fallen encryptions, the Master of Crows could  discern only that the Fallen Houses were all talking to  each other. That was a thing that had never happened  before.  Then the Techeuns looked Earthwardï¿½and saw the  Fallen there becoming bolder. Tactics suggested they  were planning a massive attack. We had no  interplanetary arraysï¿½no way to warn Earth. We  thought we would be able to do nothing but watch.  But then the Wolves arrived from the Jovians. Their  army was hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions  strong: a dark wave that washed over the Reef,  rushing toward the Earth. As soon as we saw them it  was clear that if the Wolves reached Earth, the City  would fall.  Seemingly oblivious to our existence, the bulk of the  Wolf fleet stopped to regroup at Ceres. The Queen's  decision was this: attack the House of Wolves, thereby  saving Earth but revealing the Reef's presence to any  and all enemies in the quadrant; or remain silent,  preserving the Reef's invisibility but allowing the City  to perish.  Her Harbingers ripped into Ceres, destroying the  asteroid and killing Virixas, Kell of Wolves and more  than half his House. The remaining Wolves scattered,  burrowing deep into the Belt for cover. There, new  claimants to the Kellship quickly arose: Irxis, Wolf  Baroness; Parixas, the Howling; and Skolas, the  Rabid.   Wanted: Skolas, Kell of kells  The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 1  Abstract: After the Scatter, the frontrunner for the  Kellship was Irxis, Wolf Baroness. While Skolas and  Parixas scrambled over the Kaliks servitors, Irxis  secured the command of the Orbiks servitors.  Their history is still unclear, but the Orbiks originate  with either another Fallen houseï¿½perhaps one that the  Wolves absorbed long agoï¿½or a modification of the  Kaliks servitors. Either way, the Orbiks servitors held  permissions on Kaliks servitors, which allowed Irxis to  wreak havoc among her rivals' forces at the start of  the Reef Wars.   WANTED: Mecher Orbiks-11  The Reef WarThe Wars     100  Drevis at Zire's' feet. It was Parixas.  Grayor, another of Skolas' loyal vassals, had attacked  Parixas' ketch at the same time that Drevis had  attacked Amethyst. He, too, had lured Parixas to Iris,  then the Silent Fang had used Iris' unusual brightness  to disappear just as Zire and Parixas arrived in the  system.   WANTED: Grayor, Wolf Assassin  The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 4  Abstract: After a string of defeatsï¿½at Amethyst, at  Hygiea, arguably at Irisï¿½Prince Uldren's Crows  finally made headway against the Wolves' encryption.  They quickly discovered a seemingly unimportant  piece of information: the House of Wolves had  incorrectly calculated the eccentricity of the asteroid  Bamberga.  So Paladin Imogen Rife chased Drevis, Wolf  Baroness, directly into Bamberga's trajectory. Drevis'  ketch was destroyed, and both she and her High  Servitor, Kaliks-4, were captured.  It was the first decisive Reef victory since the Scatter.  But on her way back to Vesta with her captives,  Paladin Rife was attacked at Palla.   WANTED: Drevis, Wolf Baroness  The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 5  Abstract: Under Skolas' vassal Pirsis, called Pallas-  Bane, the Wolves amassed the largest Wolf fleet that  The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 2  Abstract: What Peekis' assault lacked in finesse it  made up for in sheer numbers and desperation. Irxis'  ketches were pinned against Eos, and the two sides  engaged in the bloody, bitter battle known as the Eos  Clash, which left Irxis dead and both fleets nearly  decimated. In the aftermath, the Crows salvaged one  Orbiks servitor, Mecher Orbiks-11, believed to be the  last of its programming.  Though technically a victory for Skolas, the Eos Clash  came at a terrible cost for him. He docked Peekis'  arms and demoted him to Dreg as punishment for his  recklessness.  After the Eos Clash, Skolas changed his strategy.   WANTED: Peekis, the Disavowed  The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 3  Abstract: With Skolas and Parixas still fighting, no one  expected either to attack the Reef. So by the time  Paladin Abra Zire arrived at Amethyst it was too late:  the Silent Fang, led by Drevis herself had massacred  almost everyone in the station, including Coven Leader  Pinar Venj.  Paladin Zire gave chase, and followed the Fang to Iris,  where, behind the glare of Iris' brightness, a Wolf  ketch lay in wait. But the ketch was no match for Zire's  smaller, faster ships, or her ferocity.  When the Battle of Iris was over, however, it was not    101  had been seen since the Scatter. The Queen could not  use her Harbingers against themï¿½if she did, Imogen  Rife and her fleet and all the people of Pallas would  have been killed as well.  For years the siege endured. At first, neither side  dared to attack the other: on Pallas, Paladin Rife knew  that Pirsis had the firepower to destroy the asteroid.  Above Pallas, Pirsis held back, hoping to rescue Drevis  and Kaliks-4 and the other Wolves that Paladin Rife  had captured at the Battle of Bamberga's Wrath. The  Queen sought to diffuse the siege by sending Armada  Paladins Abra Zire and Kamala Rior into the Hildian  Asteroids, where Skolas was rumored to be hiding, but  with the help of his tactician Beltrik, the Veiled, Skolas  thwarted them.  The stalemate over Pallas was broken by, of all beings,  a dreg. Ironically dubbed Weksis the Meek, the dreg  led dozens of followers in an unsanctioned attack on  Pallas. They managed to blast a hole in the Athens  Hull, but were stopped soon after by Commander  Hallam Fen. Weksis and the surviving followers were  imprisoned alongside those they had come to save.   WANTED: Weksis, the Meek  The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 6  Abstract: Weksis' attack may have been unsuccessful,  but it inspired another, deadlier assault. This time  Pirsis, the Bane of Pallas herself led another strike,  blasting through the same Athens Hull breach that  Weksis had weakened in his assault.  Pirsis' strike team managed to free Kaliks-4, but  Paladin Imogen Rife cut them off outside Drevis' cell.  Pirsis might have escaped, but she refused to retreat  without Drevis. Paladin Rife destroyed Kaliks-4 to  prevent the Wolves from recovering it, and eventually  the Wolves were forced backï¿½but not before Pirsis  slew Paladin Rife with her own blade.  Finally, Commander Hallam Fen, Imogen Rife's  protï¿½gï¿½, was able to establish a line of communication  with the rest of the Reef. Working with the Techeuns  and the Crows, they created an enormous visual  illusion of the Harbingers, making it seem as if the  Queen had finally decided to cut her losses and  destroy the asteroid. It workedï¿½the false Harbingers  so scared the Wolf fleet that they broke ranks. Then the  combined forces of Commander Fen, Paladin Leona  Bryl and Paladin Kamala Rior slammed, capturing  Pirsis, Pallas-Bane and driving the rest of the Wolves  off.  Hallam Fen brought Drevis to Vesta, years after  Imogen Rife had set out to do so. As a reward for his  service, the Queen bequeathed him Rife's place  among the Seven Paladins.   WANTED: Pirsis, Pallas-Bane  The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 7  Abstract: Finally, Beltrik, the Veiled left the Hildians  and massed his fleet at Fortuna, to replenish his  ketches' Ether from the organic compounds found on  the asteroid's surface. His ships landed on Fortuna one  at a time, the rest forming a defensive screen around    102  its surface. He believed that Paladin Zire would attack  the screen and destroy her fleet against the shield  wall.  But Abra Zire's fury over the Battle of False Tidings  had chilled over the years into an icy, clever resolve.  She separated her forces in two, and engaged  Beltrik's veil with what he thought was her entire host.  But in secret, Abra deployed her second fleet with a  weapon the Reef had been working on since  Bamberga: Carybdis, a gravity weapon strong  enough to knock asteroids off course. Carybdis caught  asteroid Tinette in its beam and flung it into Fortuna,  destroying both and severely damaging Beltrik's fleet.  Beltrik was easily captured in the ensuing chaos, and  brought swiftly to the Queen. The fight became known  as the Fortuna Plummet, as are, on occasion, the  remains of Fortuna and Tinette as well.  After the Fortuna Plummet, one of Prince Uldren's  Crows returned with a message from a Fallen, by the  name of Variks, of the House of Judgment.   WANTED: Beltrik, the Veiled  The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 8  Abstract: In desperation, Skolas personally led an allout  assault on the military fortress of Cybele. Little did  he know that the Queen knew of his plans, thanks to  the word of Variks of the House of Judgment. No  sooner had Skolas' ketches arrived at the asteroid than  all four Armada Paladinsï¿½Abra Zire, Kamala Rior,  Leona Bryl and Hallam Fenï¿½caught him in a pincer  movement. Kaliks-12, the High Servitor of Skriviks, the  Sharp-Eyed, tried to escape, but Abra Zire chased it  down.  Skolas' Cybele Uprising had failed. He, Skriviks,  Kaliks-12 and the rest of his leaders were cast into the  Queen's prison. The Reef Wars were effectively over.   WANTED: Kaliks-12  The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 9  Abstract: Variks of the House of Judgment declared  Queen Mara Sov the new Kell of Wolves, and advised  those captured at Cybele to serve her. The first among  these to pledge their loyalty to the Queen was one  called Saviks, who was given the honor of serving in  the Queen's throne room, to the right of the Queen  herself.  [See Book IX, Chapter 3, subsection "The  Queenbreakers."]   WANTED: Saviks, Queenbreaker  The Maraid, Book VIII, Chapter 10  Abstract: Though many Wolves knelt to the Queen,  some refused to admit the war was over. A group of  Wolves rallied under the banner of a new would-be  Kell: Veliniks, called the Ravenous.  But before Veliniks could strike at the Reef, the Reef  struck at him: Lieutenant Petra Venj, a Corsair who had  served under Paladin Abra Zire during the Hildian  Campaign, hunted down and captured Veliniks.

The  Hive     107       109  4.1 GHOST FRAGMENTS: HIVE    Authors Note: The follow are gathered fragments from our encounters with  the Hive. For a history on the Hive species as a whole you will need to delve  into the Book of Sorrows recovered from the Hive Dreadnaught during the  invasion of Oryx. The tales told there are too dark and long to cover here.    I have seen chasms beneath the  surface, falling away to green  nothingness. I have seen black  seeders prepared for invasion.  Their strength is not their own. They  draw from another force, something  that corrupts, that distorts, that eats  and will not be satisfied.  The Wizard is near. I feel her  presence as a rip and a knot in the  world. She tells me things that I  immediately forget. I am too small to  hold the vastness of them, or the  terror.  I am fading. I have no more that it  can take. With my last light I say to  the City: War comes again from the  Moon. This time they want Earth.  Prepare.   Ghost Fragment: Hive 2  At the doors to the Temple he fell for  the last time. He fell, and I could not  reach him.  My own Light flickers.  They took me down into the dark, past  tiers of massed Hive, more than we  believed could exist. Past grisly  nurseries hung with pupae. Past  writhing worms that they swallow  whole. I saw the armaments of war.  I am weak, so weak.  They have clamped me to this spire  while a black foulness eats my Light.  The Wizard comes now and then to  probe with her scaly claws into my  systems, to inquire about my making,  the City, what I have seen. I erase and  dump as quickly as I can - they will  learn little from me - but I am studying  them, I know - pain.  Always pain.    110  We were overwhelmed. I could not save mine, so I  have hidden myself where I might be found by the  others, if they even survive. There is most likely no  possibility of my return to the City. I prepare here in  summary the knowledge so painfully won by my  Guardian and our fireteam.  The Moon has been geoengineered into an  impregnable fortress, designed to support a vast  number of - creatures - if any mind could be evil  enough to create them. Are they alive? They move,  they shriek, they fall upon us in ravenous waves. But I  see death, decay, and corruption, not life. We  discovered, to our sorrow, one massive set of  gates. There are likely more.  We met a towering monster, wielding a sword of  utter darkness. The Light only made it hungry. We  tried to fight, and we fell. Too many times to  remember.  We were all brave, I assure you. May the Light  find Guardians capable of facing this monstrosity,  or I fear the Moon may be lost to us forever.   Ghost Fragment: Hive    111  "The nightmares will crawl across this world and  the machines of old will rest silent as they witness  the final Light of this seemingly eternal dusk."  Ikora: And this Omnigul is here? On Earth?  Eris: I can feel it.  Ikora: Why?  Eris: Sheï¿½s left the Hellmouth. Her inner chambers  are active. More so than I have seen. But she is no  longer in the shadows.  Ikora: No, notï¿½I don't question your belief. Iï¿½m  asking why she is here. Why Earth? Please, try to  be clear. There is no time for cryptic half-answers  and almost-truths.  Eris: Heh.  Ikora: She still laughs.  Eris: It seems I have become more like the Speaker  ï¿½ Ikora: Secrets have their places. Here, now, is not  that place. Omnigul. Tell me what youï¿½ve learned.  Tell me how we stop her.  Eris: There may be no stopping what comes. The  Hive in Old Russiaï¿½in that dead landï¿½their  assault on the Cosmodrome is no coincidence.  They move against the Light with purpose. Always  with purpose.  Ikora: The Warmind?  Eris: Rasputin. Yes. The last fail safe against the  night.  Ikora: Heï¿½s still yet to heed our callsï¿½  Eris: Iï¿½m aware.  Ikora: ï¿½but seems just.  Eris: Just is enough. Just can save us all.  Ikora: And the Hive?  Eris: They will tear into its eyesï¿½or worse.  Ikora: Worse?  Eris: The dust and bone and horror of their  existence is simply whoï¿½what they are. But it does  not negate their ageless intelligence.  Ikora: They do not seek to destroy Rasputin.  Eris: I donï¿½t know. Destroying Rasputin would cost  us a treasure beyond belief. But, such fury twisted  to the Hiveï¿½s ends?  Ikora: We would fall.  Eris: All would fall.  Ikora: The Omnigul is here for Rasputin.  Eris: She is here to pave the way.  Ikora: For Crota?    112  Eris: That could just be the beginning. He's not  their only god.  Ikora: As I am learning. I will make the others  listen.  Eris: It may be too late.  Ikora: Then you need a new army.  Eris: Iï¿½ve made that mistake before.  Ikora: You saved us all. Your sacrificeï¿½  Eris: I am still here. My sacrifice wasï¿½  Ikora: Enough.  Eris: And I should ask new heroes to fall... as they  did?  Ikora: It is why we were reborn in the Light.  Eris: My Light is all but gone.  Ikora: Cherish what remains, but know that you  have done enough. Your time in the shadows... I  can't fathomï¿½  Eris: My role among the Hidden is an honor.  Ikora: None would argue. But it's had its cost.  Your place is to gather the understanding we need  to wage these wars, but your own war is long  done. Let those prepared to fight, fight.  Eris: And should they die?  Ikora: None who walk these Towers is afraidï¿½and  Rasputin must not fall.  Eris: Then Omnigul must be stopped.  Ikora: Two goals that appear to be one and the  same.  Eris: Perhaps. So I am to stay?  Ikora: I will see to it.  Eris: Then let us hope we are strong enough to  stand against what is upon usï¿½and hope the  others do not follow.   Ghost Fragment: Hiive 3    113  Transcribed from a stolen copy of the journals of  Toland, the Shattered (unverified by any cryptoarcheologist)  If your Light is strong enough to hear across the  soundless plains, you may have heard their  screams.  What may seem like a void between their shrieks,  holds, what I believe to be yet another clue to  their origins. In one tone the Hive plea to their  gods, but in the next, they whisper to another.  Perhaps it is here which holds the answer to their  ultimate demise, or a bridge to their desires. In my  studies, I still struggle to match the tones to their  rune system. If only Crytparch Adonna were still  with us. No one has yet to match her adept.  Four sounds, oft repeated, but only four. Though I  am on the trail of a fifth, faintly heard from the  buzz that once spilled from the Shrineï¿½  Eir.  Ur.  Xol.  Yul.  It is in these sounds that I fear yet another Hive  secret hides. Perhaps beyond their gods, perhaps  in accord with them. Perhaps these are just Hive  translations of worlds we call another name, but I  believe above all things they call to some kind of  being. Beings that once lived, or still live  somewhere buried amongst us. Beings the Hive  perhaps owe their very existence to.  I am hoping the Warminds may hold further  answersï¿½that they can see into worlds where we  can only see what lies upon them. The treasure of  knowledge they promise still remains the most  sought after of any Guardian. Whoever can find a  way past their firewalls of ancient arts, and make  them the allies they once were, could spare us  further atrocities. And though Rasputin offers some  promise, one can only hope its silence is selfdefense,  that it seeks only to preserve itself. We  have to prove to it that we are on its side, but I am  starting to doubt that is absolutely true. That maybe  the Hive or the Darkness itself now have a grasp  on his systems.  But then again, I am an old man with many fears,  and in those fears , often called madness, I will  continue to dwell.   Ghost Fragment: Hive 4    4.2  HIVE  COMBAT     116  Thrall  "The shadows have claws."  Feral and fearless, Thrall are a plague upon the battlefield.  Their swarming, twisted frames are driven by unfettered rage. Of all the  terrors born of the Hive's vile will, they are the basest.   Thrall  Acolyte  "Belief is a powerful weapon."  It would be a mistake to view the Hive's Acolytes as  foot soldiers, because the Hive is not merely an army, it  is a dark force rising. It is belief and horror, and its  Acolytes are its instruments, hungry to commit the  atrocities that will drive their own ascension.   Acolyte  Knight  "It put up a hand and swallowed the rocket with a wall of shadow."  A roaring, striding fortress, the Knight is the Hive's foremost and most  zealous defender. Centuries of battle have toughened the bony protrusions  on its body into an armor as hard as relic iron - a defense only strengthened  by the Hive magic that Knights use to summon shields of burning force.   Knight  HIVE RANKS     Ogre  "Itsgazeshatteredtherock,andthenitsmashedtherocktopowder.""Itsgazeshatteredtherock,andthenitsmashedtherocktopowder." Charged  with  Hive  sorcery,  Ogres  are  abominations  of  flesh  and  rage,  unleashed  from  the  deepest  Hive  tunnels  as  engines  of  destruction.  Apocryphal  lore  suggests  that  Ogres  undergo  terrible  transformations  as  they  grow  -agonizing  rituals  that  gift  them  with  might  and  cunning.

There is an army in their  shadows." - Ikora Rey  Boiling from the wounded surface of the Moon, the Hidden Swarm is the  Hive's outermost line of defense - a numberless legion that repels intruders  before they breach the temples and shrines of the vast Hive fortress.   The Hidden Swarm  Crota's Spawn  "Crota's spawn will snuff out the worlds of Light, and  Oryx's coming shall be unfettered." - Osiris  The heralds of a dark future, led by the champion of a  long-forgotten king. Crota and his legions once  banished us from our own Moon. Now we fear they  are rising again to claim Earth.   Crota's Spawn  Blood of Oryx  "They are the shadow of an unknown master, harbingers of a power  beyond anything we've faced." - Master Rahool  Research into the cyphers and runes of the Hive leads the Cryptarchs to  believe the Hive sects all serve one great master.

Kranox, the Graven is said to be the Keeper of the Worlds' Grave, a vast  repository chronicling the Hive's history of interstellar conquests. Every world  they have devoured, every life they have eradicated, every enemy they've  faced.  Defeating Kranox and cracking the secrets of the Worlds' Grave could  provide the City with the keys to unraveling the Hive's true goals and their  ultimate plans for Earth.   Kranox, The Graven  Swarm Princes  "The royalty of nightmare."  The Swarm Princes are terrible legends. It was their will  that forged the Sword of Crota, a weapon meant to  ravage worlds - the Great Render of Light, the Darkest  Edge. They have waited in the shadows of the Hellmouth  for their master's return, guarding the Sword and sating its  ravenous hunger with the Light of Guardians who have  dared to challenge them.   Swarm Princes  Sardok, Eye of Oryx  "Until the Darkness reigns, the Eyes must never close."  There are whispers of shrines to the fabled Oryx peppered across the entire  system. Stories tell of walking nightmares, protectors of bone and fury,  towering over these prized chambers.   Sardok, Eye of Oryx    125  Mormu, Xol Spawn  "How many horrors have they summoned?"  Behind every dark ritual lurks a coven of Wizards, the architects of the  Hive's unspeakable designs. Mormu, born of the blood and flesh of Xol, is  said to conduct terrible rituals upon the Hive's Ogres.   Mormu, Xol Spawn  Phogoth, The Untamed  "The summoning tempers their rage...but first that rage  must be stoked."  Phogoth's presence in the Summoning Pits reveals yet  another of the Hive's depraved designs - a ritual of  rebirth, where an Ogre's ravenous hunger and violence  is honed and given purpose.   Phogoth, the Untamed  Urrox, Flame Prince  "The ground upon which you walk shall burn. YOU shall burn."  Prince to none, Urrox kept watch over a long-forgotten brood long ago.  With the remnants of that spawn at his side, Urrox calls out to all wielders of  the Lightï¿½ to burn away all they are until only the Darkness remains.   Urrox, Flame Prince    126  Telthor, Unborn  "If you see an Ogre, you know you're close to something the Hive values."  The Unborn are those Ogres who have yet to be given the honor of a summoning.  Brute enforcers with a singular hunger for destruction, the Unborn serve the will of  their greater Hive overlords. Those Ogres that display loyalty and strength will be  called for an agonizing ritual that earns them the title "Reborn."  Telthor, protector of the Chamber of Night, is kept hungry and chained, awaiting the  moment when an interloper breaks open the Chamber and threatens the Hive's  hateful ambitions.   Telthor, Unborn  Urzok, The Hated  "By pleasing their gods, the Hive carve scars on the fabric of our realm." -Toland,  the Shattered  Among the lesser Hive, there is no higher honor than that of the Hated.  Not all can be hallowed, fewer still gods, but all can do their part to smite the Light.  The Hated, though, holds a unique place among the Hive. It is a singular position.  Only ever one. And the emerald marrow on its blade is not from combat, but the  ritualistic execution of those the Wizards have deemed Forsaken.  Urzok, The Hated    127  The Forsaken  "Conjured with but one purpose... to die." -Toland, the Shattered  How does one call through the Darkness? Through the void of the eternal night sky?  Through the pathways that link the Hive to their ancient, rotting deities? With  suffering.  The Forsaken are conjured and birthed through ritual, meant to serve as worship to  gods of a higher plane of misery. To perform a ritual of sacrifice is to tempt a god's  hunger. What then, if a being of the Light were to taint such a ritual? Would the Hive  be punished? Would their gods grow angry?   The Forsaken  Wretched Knight  "They who walk as bone, would walk upon your bones."  As the Worm Keepers wrestled for control of the disparate broods within the Prison  of Elders it was the Wretched Knights they turned to as their enforcers.  The Worm Keepers solidified their hold over the Wretched Knights by promising  them the spoils of the Light.

CROTA,SONOFORYX    129  My Thoughts on Recent Events  He hides in the dark below: the monster of Luna, the  titanic god-Knight who walked the regolith beneath a sky  of green fire and butchered the greatest army of  Guardians ever assembled. We abandoned the Moon  rather than face him.  Whispered lore and fragmentary theories suggest that  Crota represents a distinct class of Hive entities, not  resident in our material world. My latest synthesis of this  scattered esoterica suggests that Crota's 'home' is a  universe created or remade by his power and occupied  by Hive organisms of immense age. Any Guardian  formidable enough to return with information on this dark  reality might help us understand the Hive's goals for our  own worldï¿½and, more pressingly, such an expedition  might provide the key to Crota's defeat.  The epithet Son of Oryx is an ambiguous translation,  often disputed. At this time, no direct action by Hive  entities of more expansive power has ever been  observed. Those who trade in Hive lore bicker over the  exact positioning of Crotaï¿½is his world the apex of Hive  power, or is it the youngest and most accessible of a  string of netherworlds, each host to a more terrible Hive  archentity?  The nature and possible interrelationship of the Vex gate  system with Hive netherworlds remains unexplored.  Ikora   Crota, Son of Oryx    130  My name is Eriana-3, disciple of the Praxic Warlocks, marked by the  Cormorant Seal. Survivor of the great disaster: the day we set out to  retake our moon, united in a host of thousands, and found ourselves  outmatched by one Hive champion of unspeakable power.  The monster's name is Crota. He killed my friends face to face, one by  one, and he relished it. In the name of all those lost I devote myself to  his utter destruction.  This is my confession. If I transgress in your eyes I ask for your  forgiveness.  In our world Crota seemed invincible. Together Eris Morn and I worked  the problem, but found no hope. So we sought forbidden knowledgeï¿½  the exiled master of Hive arcana.  We found Toland.  Toland tells us that Crota's presence in our world is a shadow. That its  true power resides in a netherworld forged by his will. We must pass  through a keyhole between realities, navigate the seething midnight of  Crota's world-mind, and overthrow the ascendant champions that  gather to his throne.  Toland speaksï¿½he hardly seems mad, at timesï¿½of the terrible things  that await us. A secret song he hungers to learn, and the issue of that  song, an ashen burning star-husk that looms above, the utter antithesis  of life. He talks of it with a curious ambition I do not want to  understand.  Tomorrow I will ask Agah, Mota and Tarlowe if they will go with us. If  we fail, I leave this record for Guardians to come. Remember us.   Crota's End  "One sword stands tallest among them, leading the charge  against us all."  Vell: So this Sardon is one of these Swarm Princes?  Toland: In a stretch of the concept, sure. He is their lord and  master. They are his generals.  Vell: Sounds like my kind of fight.  Omar: What isn't?  Vell: Eris and Eriana said the Blades rose first and slaughtered our  brothers and sisters. If the one who leads their charge is within  reach, I mean to end himï¿½to end them all.  Eris: We are here for Crota.  Toland: I'm afraid each disciple is Crota.  Vell: Then it must be done. Know that I have faith in your Light, as I  do in my own.  Eris: This isnï¿½t about faith.  Eriana-3: Itï¿½s about vengeance.  Vell: Itï¿½s about the only thing that mattersï¿½victory. Itï¿½s about doing  what we must to end this terror.  Eris: We will face them all, together. We have no time to fight  individual battles.  Toland: I have no doubt the Fist will welcome your challenge,  Titan. When we face him, you will lead the charge. Come, Crota's  Temple lies ahead. If we can breach it, I'm sure another fight  awaits.   Sardon, Fist of Crota    131  "They are the heralds of our destroyer. Ushers of this coming storm."  Vell: Theyï¿½re more than Knights.  Eriana-3: They look like Knights.  Vell: Thatï¿½s like calling you a tin can.  Eriana-3: Excuse me?  Vell: Iï¿½m saying calling them Knights is an understatement.  Omar: What are they then?  Toland: World carvers.  Omar: Meaning?  Toland: Those swords are neither bone nor steel. Thereï¿½s a dark purpose  to their edge.  Eriana-3: Darker than death?  Toland: Death is peace compared to the shadows.  Omar: Those Blades cut down more Guardians than I can count.  Vell: Hundreds.  Eriana-3: Thousands. The Vanguard shouldï¿½ve known better.  Toland: I tried to warn them.  Omar: But weï¿½re prepared?  Vell: I am.  Omar: Not exactly the question.  Eris: I have a feeling Light wonï¿½t be enough.  Eriana-3: Then weï¿½ll take their swords from their ashes, and cut them  down one-by-one, Blade-by-Blade.  Eris: You would wield a weapon of the night?  Eriana-3: For herï¿½them? I will butcher any who stand in my way  with even the darkest blade.  Eris: Pray it doesnï¿½t come to that.  Vell: Heh. To cleave our enemies with their own tools of destruction?  We should be so lucky.  Omar: Youï¿½ve got a strange view on luck.  Toland: When youï¿½ve got your hand around the hilt and their ash  under your boot, you might change your tune, Hunter.   Blades of Crota  "The Eyes watch us all, gathering our secrets in hopes of ending the  Light."  Eris: Something is watching us. I can feel it.  Omar: I hate when you say that.  Toland: Crota has many Eyes. Every god does.  Eris: We have to go.  Omar: If they know our every move, what chance do we have?  Toland: With their great age comes even greater wisdom. I have no  doubt the Hive led us here with intent.  Omar: What are you saying?  Toland: For these disciples, we offer the greatest sacrifice.  Eris: What does that mean?    132  Toland: Do you feel your Light fading? They are offering it to Crota. Us  coming here, we are the ones waking him.  Omar: Heï¿½s mad.  Toland: Perhaps.  Eris: Why do you hold these secrets like weapons, to damn us all?  Toland: Because they are weapons. And we are going to use them to  show the Hive they are not the only ones who breed fear.  Eris: How?  Toland: Youï¿½re huntersï¿½hunt. Find the Eyes that are upon us.  Omar: Then?  Toland: We blind Crota and use what's left of your dying Light to lead  us to where these monsters seek to conjure their master.   Eyes of Crota  "That shriek, that wicked laugh. If you listen closely, you can hear  power in its song.ï¿½  Eris: Those screams.  Omar: And I was just starting to tune them out.  Toland: It has been told that with these screams another spawn is  awakened, birthed in the name of the god it holds.  Sai: Crota.  Toland: I am afraid so. They call this one Omnigul, mother of the  spawn.  Sai: How do youï¿½? I'd rather not know.  Toland: Commands, echoed through the dark, fetid cavernsï¿½orders  carried out with grinding stone and squeaking claw, skittering thrall and  blade against bone.  Omar: Well, now he's on a roll.  Eriana-3: I hear them, even when I don't. I will tear this Omnigul's  throat out.  Toland: If you were to do so, our work here would be done.  Without a Will to raise its army and herald its ascendance, there is  no Crota to fear, at least here and now.  Eris: Then we follow the screams.   Omnigul, Will of Crota    Authors Note: It is hard to determine the order of events  from this point onwards. The next few accounts have been  arranged as best we can determine. It appears at some point  the group was seperated. From the fragments I know that  Eriana-3 and Sai were together in one group and Eris and  Toland in another. I am unsure of how they were seperated  and only know of the fate of Omar and Vell from the final  account that I can only assume is Toland's.      133  "It crawls from the shadows to claim our Light in the name of Crota."  Sai: Can you track the others?  Eriana-3: No. There is too much interference. The shroud is too thick  here. Ghost?  Ghost: <chhk> Yes. <chhk>  Eriana-3: We in bad shape?  Ghost: <chhk> Could be better. <chhk>  Eriana-3: Any charge?  Ghost: No. Something is siphoning the Light. <chhk> Iï¿½m getting weaker  by the second. <chhk>  Eriana-3: And Saiï¿½s Ghost? Same?  Ghost: Faint charge detected <chhk> but itï¿½s fading. Its shell is  damaged beyond repair. <chhk> No comms. No transmat. <chhk>  Even if there were a signalï¿½  Eriana-3: Use whatever juice youï¿½ve got and relay this transmission to  the others.  Ghost: They won't receive it. <chhk>  Eriana-3: Not the point.  Eriana-3: This is Eriana-3 of the Praxic Warlocks. Marked by the  Cormorant Seal. I am alongside the Hunter Sai Mota. Our Light is  nearly gone. The ash of untold Hive covers the ground in our wake.  Unknown: [inaudible scream]  Sai: Omnigulï¿½  Eriana-3: From what Toland has described we are on the path of  Crota's dreaded Hand.  Sai: The Hand is falling back toward the screams beyond these  tunnels.  Eriana-3: Screw it. You ready?  Sai: My knives are eager for another dance.  Eriana-3: You speak little, Sai Mota, but always say the right things.   Hand of Crota  "It is a mountain of rage, summoned to leave only destruction in its  path."  Toland: When a god's Will is met with force, its Might will be  unleashed in the form of those raging beasts we call the ogreï¿½  monsters bred of pain, tormented by the Light, nothing but hatred  for all who bring its suffering forth.  Eris: And how do you know this?  Toland: It was told to me.  Eris: By the Speaker?  Toland: By the Darkness itself.   Might of Crota  Eriana! Let's sing. Sing with me. No, no, you rattling machine, not  yet, it's too soon: we don't know the words.  We'll learn the song down there. We can learn it from Her. She  comes up from the deep dark places where the greater Hive await  to sing it to us, and here's a puzzle for youï¿½  The song is death. To hear it is to die. To know the words is mortal.  Oh, good point, Eriana, death is just a word, isn't it? A catch-all  term for the failure to go on, nothing spiritual, nothing with its own  quiddity. We all died once, and it did not prove insurmountable.  But what if what if what if, shhh listen, what if death were reified,  described in its totality, made autonomous and universal, separate    134  from any context or condition? What if She could invoke the ending of  anything?  How, then, would She know the song, and sing it, without Herself  dying?  Perhaps they know a way to make themselves part of the song, part of  something vast and burning that rots and peels into ash but never ever  ends. Perhaps She has engineered this for Him, and pinned His power  up against the quiddity of death itself.  I am so terribly curious to know.   Ir Yut, the Deathsinger  ï¿½Itï¿½s not the first and surely is not the last. But until the last Heart stops,  their hate will spread endlessly across the black."  Eris: Record this.  The Heart of Crota.  It is her blood that feeds their fury.  I thought Omar dead until I heard his screams. I followed them down, to  the darkest night of the caverns below. What I sawï¿½I witnessed all we  fearï¿½the villainy of the Hive on full display.  Among a sea of cocoons, and surrounded by thousands more freshly  spawned hordes, the Heart held Omarï¿½s broken body in a vice of bone  and pain. She was peeling the Light from his body. How? I canï¿½t  imagine, and I have tried. Tendrils of luminance tore away like flesh.  With every strand Omarï¿½s scream cut the dark and was met with a  chittering chorus from the unborn. I canï¿½t say if they were feeding off the  Light itself, or the pain, but my guess is bothï¿½somehow, both.  The Heart, though I canï¿½t believe she actually has one, seemed to be  conducting some nightmare orchestra, nurturing Crotaï¿½s children, with  the echoes of Agahï¿½s Light.  The Hive must end for all they had done, and some day, by my hand or  anotherï¿½s, the Heart will meet with an end fitting of the pain she,  herself, has dealt.   Heart of Crota    135  For Wei. I am sorry.  My Ghost's Light is so dim, there's no point following me further into this  fog ï¿½ any hope of raising me died halfway through the Stills ï¿½ I only  hope she's got strength enough to take this ember to where you fell, to  dance once more with any last whisper of your own light left on this  cursed, broken rock.  Again I will confess. I am Eriana-3, of the Praxic Fire, and I know my  flame goes out down here. I will burn bright and hot and raze a  thousand Hive to ash as I go, but I know we will not end him ï¿½ The one  who fell you, and hundreds more, with that foul blade.  I now beg, as I feared, for your forgiveness. I will not avenge you, but  join you amongst the fires snuffed out upon this moon.  I was a fool to lead us here. I was blinded by the loss of so much, by  your light extinguished. I put my trust, and the light of four others, in a  madman, and I bear witness to their fall into darkness and death.  Toland's song was nothing but screams, and we go now to sing with  them. We will not return.  I only hope now that my foolish charge will serve as a record of  warning. So that no other Guardians go to face this monster and those  that serve him ï¿½ and those beasts beyond imagining that he must serve  in the realm I now go forth to die in. That this tiny bit of Light, joined  with yours, and Sai's, Vell, and poor Omar's ï¿½ that it might spark a  torch of warning to leave this dead and broken moon as Crota's prize.  Let the Titans on their walls and towers look up at night to this glowing  reminder in the sky that your Light fell below the surface. Let the  moonlight fall on Hunters' eyes through the canopies of the wilds, and  guide the way of Warlocks searching their hidden paths. At night, let  them look up and see, and let us be mourned.  At night, let them remember you. And let the light of the day free them  from the curse of this memory.   Ghost Fragment: Hellmouth 2  I am dead.  Vell is spectacularly dead. Omar and Sai are quite dead too.  Eriana, poor Eriana, she was so very bright at the end, wasnï¿½t she?  A brave light.  But Crota was unmoved. That shadow is detached from its source.  Light makes it darker. I could feel His presence and if I still had a  Ghost I am sure it would have screamed.  I, too, am detached from my source. The charming Ir Yï¿½t made her  introductions, and I was very pleased to meet her. We had a  conversation, a little tï¿½te-ï¿½-Yï¿½t, a couple old wizards exchanging  definitions.  I defined myself a friend. She defined for me the quiddity of death,  and she sang the song of that fearful autonomy. Revelation, my  friends, it does go down hard. The definition killed me. The killing  redefined me.  This is the shape and the point of the tooth: nothing has ever lived  that will not die.  Now I fly between green-black suns in the labyrinth beyond Crotaï¿½s  god-star. This is the Overworld, the Sea of Screams, where the  throne-universes of the great Hive fester in eternal majesty. I move  among them. I map the shapes and connections of this world.  I want to appear in the Tower and taunt them, lo, lo, I never sleep, I  dance in light and shadow, I never sleep, I will never die. I will  never die. I want to ask them: if you followed your laws here, to this  trembling fearful place, of what use were those laws?  But I have work to do. I shout into deep places. Osiris! I call. Osiris,  Osiris! Can you hear me?  Sometimes I think he answers. Sometimes I wonder what became of  Eris. She was very tenacious.  For the first time I am lonely.

Yes, the father of all your burdens comes to you with hate on his sword  and hunger in his heart. But don't look at it that way. Did you not, when  you lost your sight, gain another?  Sharpen your intentions. When life is strength and strength is death,  what is death, if not hope?  You just have to reach out and take it.   Oryx, The Taken King  In World the stars never shone,  The worm never bred in our flesh,  We lived for a day  Our teeth were too short  We were hungry for things we could not eat  Hello again. Itï¿½s me. Iï¿½m sure you know my name. Let me talk a while,  let me talk, I do take a debased joy in speaking again to small humanform  heads.  When Crotaï¿½s victory over our little blue world seemed certain (a  moment of silence, now, for Wei Ning, whose directness I admired) it  was Oryx who called His Child back into the nether world to plan final  victory. It was to Oryx that the violence of His spawn was tithed.  Oryx is the wielder and the servant of a terrible truth. He has  predicated Himself on it, He has pursued across thousands of cairn  worlds His quest to embody it, and you have seen the force of that truth  expended to create these Taken.  He is not a simple thing to kill. He wants to be isomorphic to conquest,  to triumph, to killing and death. He is a syllogism, now, but in time He  hopes to become an axiom.  This is His strength and His fatal weakness.  For if he ever falters in His performance, if the inflow of devastation  ever falls behind His expenditure of ruin, He will be consumed. If He  is ever outmatched, then by the terms of His own existence, He will  cease.  It is to Oryx Himself, in the heart of the Dreadnaught that armors  and encapsulates his throne-world, that you must make your last and  surest argument.  Good luck! Do let me know if a vacancy opens.   Oryx: Rebuked  Listen ï¿½  Death is the last part of living  and life is learning to die  The song is the same as the singing  The last truth commands me  to eat all the light in the sky  I will go on forever. I will understand.  Dwell a moment on the weight of what youï¿½ve done. Contemplate  the story you just ended. Will you ever do anything that screams  down the millennia? Will you ever hammer your will on the universe  until it rings and rings and rings? Oryx was an awesome power.  Show reverence.  All right. Enough. Enough. A vacancy has opened, hasnï¿½t it?  How interesting. How very interesting.  Do you ever pause, dear listener, to consider who benefits from all  this heroism you commit? Do you ever look around you and feel the  faintest chill? As if you are the tiny little ball bearing placed beneath  a great mass, so that it might, if pushed, begin to roll?  Youï¿½re a god yourself, now. Youï¿½ve consecrated yourself. Emulate  me. Use your power to learn.  There are worse things to practice being.   Oryx: Defeated    139  Abase yourself, weapons and instruments  Submit yourself, shapes and gliders, automata all ï¿½  I am Oryx, Lord of Shapes, Carver of Tablets  Behold my performance of the Last True Shape  The final axiom  Witness the space that I define  I approach the asymptote.  I grow vast across topologies.  I am not simply connected.  Dearest Guardian,  I write to you from a place of high contempt. No no no, donï¿½t be offended,  donï¿½t be so superficial ï¿½ itï¿½s in the architecture of these spaces. They look  down on you.  I wander out here, in worlds cut by sharp Hive swords, and I send back  these messages for you.  Of Oryx, that admirable monarch, I have only a little to say. Why? Because  He is all in the action, fellow traveler, His philosophy is all on display. He  has twinned himself so closely to the power He admires. He has become  many-placed, many-formed, sending out emissaries of himself to ask after  the truth.  In each act of His power Oryx seeks to incarnate the self-sustaining,  immortal suzerainty that He worships. The power that He uses to wash his  Taken clean and etch them into useful shapes.  LISTEN! LISTEN! Understand, you simpleton, itï¿½s entirely obvious ï¿½  Oryx inhabits a world where power is truth. To win is to be noble, and to be  real. When He departs from that world, out into the material universe, He is  lessened.  The echoes of Oryx go forth to ask a question: are you the truth? And that  means ï¿½ well. You see, Iï¿½m sure.   Echo of Oryx    140  The Warpriest  Five hundred and eighty five times he paced the way Under each circuit was a world He  took up the worlds, he placed them in his hand, he weighed them  From the Golden Amputation to the Gift Mast  The principle he put upon his brow was slaughter constant and escalating  The principle he put behind his eyes was victory which is the last true shape  The principle he put into his hands was tribute ï¿½ to Oryx, King of Taking  Tithing to his Lord, that the First Navigator might escape the need to kill for subsistence,  the worm need  That He might use His power to lead the final work  A most faithful servant.

It's not good, or  you'd be on my side of the desk. And it's not  urgent, or you'd already have evacuated the  site. Which means...  ESI: I have a working interface with the  specimen's internal environment. I can see  what it's thinking.  SUNDARESH: In metaphorical terms, of  course. The cognitive architectures are so -  ESI: No. I don't need any kind of  epistemology bridge.  SUNDARESH: Are you telling me it's human?  A human merkwelt? Human qualia?  ESI: I'm telling you it's full of humans. It's  thinking about us.  SUNDARESH: About - oh no.  ESI: It's simulating us. Vividly. Elaborately. It's  running a spectacularly high-fidelity model of a  Collective research team studying a captive  Vex entity.  SUNDARESH:...how deep does it go?  ESI: Right now the simulated Maya Sundaresh  is meeting with the simulated Chioma Esi to  discuss an unexpected problem.  [indistinct sounds]  SUNDARESH: There's no divergence? That's  impossible. It doesn't have enough  information.  ESI: It inferred. It works from what it sees and  it infers the rest. I know that feels unlikely. But it  obviously has capabilities we don't. It may  have breached our shared virtual  workspace...the neural links could have given  it data...  SUNDARESH: The simulations have interiority?  Subjectivity?  ESI: I can't know that until I look more closely.  But they act like us.  SUNDARESH: We're inside it. By any  reasonable philosophical standard, we are  inside that Vex.  ESI: Unless you take a particularly ruthless  approach to the problem of causal forks: yes.  They are us.  SUNDARESH: Call a team meeting.  ESI: The other you has too.   Ghost Fragment: Vex  5.1 GHOST FRAGMENTS: VEX  Author's Note: The following are interesting  excerpts from the Ishtar Collective, a group that was  highly involved in studying the Vex and their  technology. The Ghost fragments on these few  pages show the Collective's attempt at entering a  vex mind and the complexities that arose.      152  From the Records of the Ishtar Collective  SUNDARESH: So that's the situation as we  know it.  ESI: To the best of my understanding.  SHIM: Well I'll be a [profane] [profanity]. This  is extremely [profane]. That thing has us over a  barrel.  SUNDARESH: Yeah. We're in a difficult  position.  DUANE-MCNIADH: I don't understand. So it's  simulating us? It made virtual copies of us?  How does that give it power?  ESI: It controls the simulation. It can hurt our  simulated selves. We wouldn't feel that pain,  but rationally speaking, we have to treat an  identical copy's agony as identical to our own.  SUNDARESH: It's god in there. It can simulate  our torment. Forever. If we don't let it go, it'll  put us through hell.  DUANE-MCNIADH: We have no causal  connection to the mind state of those sims.  They aren't us. Just copies. We have no  obligation to them.  ESI: You can't seriously - your OWN SELF -  SHIM: [profane] idiot. Think. Think. If it can  run one simulation, maybe it can run more  than one. And there will only ever be one  reality. Play the odds.  DUANE-MCNIADH: Oh...uh oh.  SHIM: Odds are that we aren't our own  originals. Odds are that we exist in one of the  Vex simulations right now.  ESI: I didn't think of that.  SUNDARESH: [indistinct percussive sound]   Ghost Fragment: Vex 2  ....  SUNDARESH: I have a plan.  ESI: If you have a plan, then so does your sim,  and the Vex knows about it.  DUANE-MCNIADH: Does it matter? If we're in  Vex hell right now, there's nothing we can -  SHIM: Stop talking about 'real' and 'unreal.'  All realities are programs executing laws.  Subjectivity is all that matters.  SUNDARESH: We have to act as if we're in  the real universe, not one simulated by the  specimen. Otherwise we might as well give  up.  ESI: Your sim self is saying the same thing.  SUNDARESH: Chioma, love, please hush. It  doesn't help.  DUANE-MCNIADH: Maybe the simulations  are just billboards! Maybe they don't have  interiority! It's bluffing!  SHIM: I wish someone would simulate you  shutting up.  SUNDARESH: If we're sims, we exist in the  pocket of the universe that the Vex specimen is  able to simulate with its onboard brainpower.  If we're real, we need to get outside that  bubble.  ESI: ...we call for help.  SUNDARESH: That's right. We bring in  someone smarter than the specimen. Someone  too big to simulate and predict. A warmind.  SHIM: In the real world, the warmind will be  able to behave in ways the Vex can't simulate.  It's too smart. The warmind may be able to get  into the Vex and rescue - us.  DUANE-MCNIADH: If we try, won't the Vex  torture us for eternity? Or just erase us?  SUNDARESH: It may simply erase us. But I feel  that's preferable to...the alternatives.  ESI: I agree.  SHIM: Once we try to make the call, the Vex  may...react. So let's all savor this last moment  of stability.  SUNDARESH: [indistinct sounds]  SHIM: You two are adorable.  DUANE-MCNIADH: I wish I'd taken that job at  Clovis.   Ghost Fragment: Vex 3    153  Maya, Chioma, Duane-McNiadh and Shim decide to have a picnic  before they send themselves into infinity.  Up here they have to act by biomechanical proxy. No human being in  the Ishtar Academy has ever crossed the safety cordon and walked the  ancient stone under the Citadel, the Vex construct that stabs up out of  the world to injure space and time. It's not safe. The cellular Vex  elements are infectious, hallucinogenic, entheogenic. The informational  Vex elements are more dangerous yetï¿½ and there could be semiotic  hazards beyond them, aggressive ideas, Vex who exist without a  substrate. Even now, operating remote bodies by neural link, the team's  thoughts are relayed through the warmind who saved them, sandboxed  and scrubbed for hazards. Their real bodies are safe in the Academy,  protected by distance and neural firewall.  But they walk together in proxy, pressed close, huddled in awe. Bluegreen  light, light the color of an ancient sea, washes over them. Each of  their explorer bodies carries a slim computer. Inside, two hundred  twenty-seven of copies of their own minds wait, patient and paused, for  dispersal.  "I wonder where it came from," Duane-Mcniadh says. Of course he's  the one to break the reverent silence. "The Citadel. I wonder if it was  here before the Traveler changed Venus."  "It could have been latent," Chioma Esi suggests. She's the leader. She  kept them together when it seemed like they faced actual, eternal  torture. She pulled them through. "Seeded in the crust. Waiting for a  period of geological quiescence, so it could grow."  Dr. Shim shrugs. "I think the Traveler did something paracausal to  Venus. Something that cut across space and time. The Citadel seems to  come from the past of a different Venus than our own. It doesn't have to  make any sense by our logic, any more than the Moon's new gravity."  Maya Sundaresh walks at the center of the group. She's been too quiet  lately. What happened to them wasn't her fault and maybe she'll  believe that soon. "What could you do with it?" she murmurs, staring  up. "If you understood it?"  Chioma puts an arm around her. "That's what we're going to find  out. Where the Citadel can send us. Whether we can come back."  "They're not us any more." Maya looks down at herself, at the cache  of her self-forks. "We're not going anywhere. We're sending them.  They're diverging."  They rescued themselves from the inside of a Vex mind, two hundred  and twenty-seven copies of themselves, untortured and undamaged.  Those copies voted, all unanimously, to be dispatched into the Vex  information network as explorers.  When Maya and Chioma look at each other they can tell they're  each wondering the same thing: how many of them will stay  together, wherever they go? How many fork-Mayas and fork-  Chiomas will fall out of love? How many will end up bereft,  grieving? How many will be happy, like them?  Chioma tries a little smile. Maya smiles back, haltingly, and then,  sighing, unable to stop herself, grins a big stupid grin, an everythingis- okay grin. Shim makes a loud obnoxious awwww at them. Duane-  McNiadh is still thinking about paracausality, and doesn't notice.  They climb. When they find the Vex aperture they plan to use, they  overlay the luminous stone and ancient brassy machines with images  of sun and sand. They set up the transmitters and interfaces that will  translate two hundred and twenty-seven simulations of the four of  them into Vex language, into the tangled pathways of the Vex  network, to see what's out there, and maybe come home.  In the metaphor they've chosen, setting up the equipment is like  laying out the picnic. In the metaphor they've chosen they look like  themselves, not hardened explorer proxies. Like people.  "Do you think," Duane-McNiadh begins, halting, "that you could use  this place to change things? If you regretted something, could you  find a way through the Citadel, go back, and change it?"    154  "I wish I could go back and change you into someone else," Dr. Shim  grouses. Chioma's shaking her head. She knows physics. "Time is selfconsistent,"  she says. "I think it's like the story of the merchant and the  alchemist. You could go back and watch something, or be part of  something, but if you did, then that was the way it always happened."  "Maybe you could bring something back to now. Something you  needed." Maya runs a hand across the surface of the Vex aperture,  feeling it with sensors ten thousand times as precise as a human hand.  These proxy bodies are limitedï¿½ they crash and need resetting every  few hours, they struggle with latency, they can't hold much long term  memory. But they'll get better. "Or go forward and learn something  vital. If you knew how to control it, how to navigate across space and  time."  "So it's just a way to make everything more complicated." Duane-  McNiadh sighs. "It doesn't fix anything. Nothing ever does! I should've  taken that job atï¿½ "  "You would've hated it at Clovis," Dr. Shim says. "We both know you're  happier here." Duane-McNiadh stands stunned by this courtesy, and  then they both pretend to ignore each other.  The four of them set up the interface. Their stored copies wake up and  prepare for the journey, so that as they work they find themselves  surrounded by the mental phantasms of themselves: two hundred and  twenty-seven Mayas and Chiomas knocking helmets and smiling, two  hundred and twenty-seven Dr. Shims making cynical bets with each  other about how long they'll last, two hundred and twenty-seven Duane-  McNiadhs blowing goodbye kisses to the sweet golden sun, two  hundred and twenty-seven of them shaking hands, smiling, making  ready to explore.   Ghost Fragment: Vex 4    155  RECORD 0-CHASM-0  My love. Iï¿½ve opened this log as an apology.  As a scientist, I believe in record-keeping. I believe in protocols, peer  review, and ethical conduct. I believe in the importance of disbelief ï¿½  you know: letï¿½s run that one more time.  What Iï¿½m doing here in Lhasa isnï¿½t science. Itï¿½s unethical, secret, and  shameful. And after what happened in Ishtar, dearest Chioma, I know  youï¿½d be furious with me for getting involved. Forty years isnï¿½t far  enough to forget a day like that.  But I believe itï¿½s important. The least I can do is keep a few notes for  you.  RECORD 0-CHASM-01  Trial one. Subject one.  It was an act of stupid loneliness. I used the device on myself because  I...  [silence: 0:08]  I missed you. We hadnï¿½t been apart for more than a year since we met.  Iï¿½m not a very good wife, am I? You write me every week, even with all  Hyperionï¿½s work and all Hyperionï¿½s distance keeping you from me. And  I act like itï¿½s not enough.  We built the device in mimicry of the Vex gateway systems from Ishtar.  An observatory, yes, but I think of it as a mind-ship. Capable of  displacing its payload across space and time.  The lab is cold and isolated. We are quarantined from the world,  physically and mentally. We canï¿½t send messages out. If we breach the  Vex manifolds, even our words might transmit contagion. One night last  month I missed you and so I ï¿½  I thought that I could look inside the device, and find one of the  other Chiomas. I thought I could call out to one of the forks we sent  out there to explore.  I just wanted to send my love.  RECORD 0-CHASM-02  Zakharik Gilmanovich Bekhterev. May he rest in peace. When our  probes continued to fail, when my report remained our only positive  finding, he volunteered to use the device. One minute of subjective  experience inside.  We took precautions. They worked. Bekhterevï¿½s experience left no  physical damage.    156  After we extracted him, he said that he felt determined. I asked him  what he meant and he said that he meant it, he had been determined,  he could feel all his choices set out before him like a railroad. Deviation  was impossible.  He died by suicide. I wonder if he was trying to make a point.  RECORD 0-CHASM-03  Weï¿½ve decided not to abort. Itï¿½s insane, isnï¿½t it? There are pressures on  us I canï¿½t tell you about until I see you again.  The purpose of the system is intelligence, you see. Itï¿½s stenciled right on  the hull: SxISR. Special asset. We would very much like to make it work  reliably.  Our supervisory warmind has devised a drug it says will protect and  prepare us.  I am beginning to wonder if we were wrong about the merchant and  the alchemist. Or if that explanation of time was incomplete.  RECORD 0-CHASM-09  Kind Lakpha. He meditated before he went in. Nothing but dï¿½jï¿½ vu and  three seconds of screams. The screaming passed and he remembers  nothing. The dï¿½jï¿½ vu hasnï¿½t. He says itï¿½s getting better ï¿½ he feels that  weï¿½ve had this conversation only ten times before, not a thousand.  Iï¿½ve suggested that we attempt mind forking. We need more sane  people to work with. Please forgive me, my love.  We are all growing superstitious. The behavior of the device is  inconsistent. Impossible to replicate. We turn to ritual behavior to  appease it.  RECORD 0-CHASM-31  Rajesh. When he reached a displacement of eight he told us he was  dead. I believed him. He was dead. He spoke to us. It was true.  Whatever he saw, it was his own future.  Heï¿½s fine, afterwards. When I look into his eyes I wonder what  came back wearing his skin. But that thought is unscientific.  We speak of nothing but the device. We talk about it like a  demigod. When I get out of here I know the whole world will look  like a fraying veil.  I think itï¿½s clear that part of the problem is substrate. We need more  than flesh and drug to survive this.  RECORD 0-CHASM-52  I heard you, my love. I was at six, oscillating on the event axis,  coordinated with a known manifold. I heard you. You were talking  to me ï¿½ not me, but another me, another Maya Sundaresh.  You said, my love, so many strange things have happened, and itï¿½s  been so long. Weï¿½ve come so far. Do you ever want to go home?  And I said, not me but the other me, I said, my love, I am always  home.  Iï¿½m resigning, my love. Iï¿½m done with this work and Iï¿½m done with  being apart from you. Iï¿½ll see you again soon. I canï¿½t take this  journal out with me, so Iï¿½ve left it for the others, and asked them to  continue the log.  Maybe itï¿½ll become a tradition. The gospel of our little cult.   Ghost Fragment: Vex 5    5.2  VEX  COMBAT     158  Goblin  "All their joints turning together. Moving together. Towards you."  The Goblin is the basic unit in the vast computational network that is the  Vex. Shattering the large, fan-shaped head does not seem to cause lasting  damage but sends the Goblin into a crackling frenzy.   Goblin  Hobgoblin  "The air by my cheek twanged twice, stinking of  ozone, before I saw it."  Specialized for sniping, this lean, tough Vex model is  fitted with improved optics and acute sensors in its  horns. Like the Goblin, the Hobgoblin contains a milky  radiolarian fluid.  Attacking a Hobgoblin often triggers a defensive reflex  - the Hobgoblin seals itself in stasis and waits for help.   Hobgoblin  Harpy  "It swam back and forth through the air, spinning, the single red eye looking  - I realized - for me."  The fastest and most mobile Vex, the Harpy is an airborne unit often  deployed in flocks on patrols and scouting missions. They must stop and  stabilize before attacking   Harpy.

Hydra 159       160  Hezen Corrective  We understand the Vex as a network of thoughts, unified and vast. But not all Vex are the  same. The Hezen Corrective is one example of a Vex subtype, set apart from other Vex by  distinct behaviors and objectives.  Swarming across the Ishtar Sink, these Vex aggressively seek out and attack the Fallen  House of Winter, perform inscrutable operations around shining Confluxes, and even  show interest in the Golden Age ruins left by the Ishtar Collective.  The bulk of our contact with Vex forces on Venus has involved the Corrective. Those  scholars willing to risk their reputations speculating about the Vex often assert that the  Corrective is an agent of change, designed to solve problems and remake the world in a  form suitable to the Vex. Others contend that Corrective is simply a strategic distraction -  meant to draw attention away from the actions of the Hezen Protective.   Hezen Corrective  Hezen Protective  The mysterious Hezen Protective is the second major Vex behavioral unit on Venus.  Concentrated around the legendary Vault of Glass and the Endless Steps, the site of a  massive Vex gate and the access point to the towering Citadel, the Protective's behavior  seems very defensive.  But leading Cryptarchs and experienced Guardians warn that it would be a fatal  mistake to think of the Vex as a conventional military occupying an area. Vex behavior  is always a process, active and purposeful. The Protective is clearly engaged in a  colossal project, but as with much Vex behavior, it's unclear whether their ultimate  purpose is even comprehensible to us. The Protective may be reacting to an event that  has yet to occur, or working towards a goal that - to us - is already historical fact.   Hezen Protective  VEX SUBTYPES     161  Virgo Prohibition  Mars is wracked by an ongoing theater-level conflict between the Cabal and a Vex  subtype known as the Virgo Prohibition. These aggressive, relentless Vex constantly test the  Cabal exclusion zone, apparently heedless of losses.  In spite of the Vex onslaught, the Cabal have managed to expand its beachhead and  maintain a hold on several mysterious Vex structures. The Prohibition's tactics seem to be  failing in the short run.  But it seems unlikely that an organization with the sheer computational scope of the Vex  could be dragged into a losing war of attrition. Is it possible that the Vex are trying to  draw out the Cabal strength? Or that their surface losses are a distraction from a deeper  strategic ploy?  Ikora Rey has proposed that the Vex units can best be understood as algorithms - each a  unique mapping of inputs to behavioral responses. Perhaps the Virgo Prohibition is simply  the wrong algorithm for its environment, and its failure will drive the greater Vex network to  adapt and improve.   Virgo Prohibition  Sol Divisive  Beyond the towering Meridian Bay gate lies the Black Garden, adrift in time and space.  And within the Garden dwell the Vex of the Sol Divisive, frozen in rapture.  We have precious little insight into the Divisive's behavior. They seem central to Vex  actions in the solar system: the Garden is clearly a place of enormous power.  Legends and scant field reports all indicate that the Divisive Vex behave religiously.  Why would a hyperintelligent, time-spanning thought mesh exhibit religious behavior?  The answer seems as obvious as it is chilling: if the Vex found worship and devotion  more effective than any other behavior, they would adopt worship. Whatever the Vex  found - or made - in the Garden, it transcends even their power.   Sol Divisive    Precursors    Sol  Primeval    Those  who  delve  deep  into  the  Vault  of  Glass  have  seen  time  itself  torn  asunder.  Awestruck  Ghosts  report  encounters  with  ancient  Vex,  their  casings  built  long  before  the    ageofhumanity. It  would  be  easy  to  assume  these  Vex  are  the  ancestors  of  those  we  face  today  -but  with    theVexitisneversosimple.  Precursors    Descendants    Sol  Imminent    Survivors  of  the  Vault  of  Glass  report  sightings  of  ancient  Vex  -ancient  in  the  sense  that  they  have  endured  for  eons.  Convergent  analysis  from  multiple  Ghosts  suggests  that  these  Vex  exist  in  our  future.    IftheVexexistinourfuture-orinapossiblefuture-shouldwetakethisasevidencethattheirdefeatisimpracticalorunattainable?TheGuardianVanguardisquicktopoint out  that  time  travel  remains  a  mystery,  and  that  the  continued  existence  of  the  Vex  is  not  remotely  a  sure  indication  of  humanity's  extinction.   Descendants     162       163  Slap Rifle  From a tactical perspective, the Slap Rifle is a Vex directed-energy weapon that fills their  analog of the light infantry role. From an engineering perspective it's something much  more interesting: a terminal. The Slap Rifle receives a bolt of Solar energy from  somewhere (or somewhen) else and it points it at a target.  The terminal's flexibility is impressive. In non-combat conditions, the Slap Rifle seems like  it might serve as a viable field transmitter, construction tool, navigational beacon,  network repeater, or any of a number of other utility functions.   Slap Rifle  Line Rifle  The Vex Line Rifle fires high-velocity Solar particle jets. Deployed on the Hobgoblin chassis,  the Line Rifle serves as a sniper weapon, pinning down targets or delivering the killing  blow.  Like the Slap Rifle, the Line Rifle is a terminal weapon, although its source is much more  energetic. Some believe the weapon pulls material from the accretion disk of a galactic  singularity. This would imply the Vex are near - or have already achieved - access to a  terrifying range of civilization-killing weapons. Others consider this unlikely, and propose  that the Line Rifle simply draws from a central Vex power supply.   Line Rifle  VEX WEAPONRY     164  Torch Hammer  The Torch Hammer is a devastating Vex heavy weapon. Firing projectiles of  strange matter, the Hammer mauls targets with exotic particle decay and  deadly radiation.   Torch Hammer  Slap Grenade  The Vex use Slap Grenades to drive targets out into the  open. These devices behave more like miniaturized  gates than conventional explosives, channeling a Void  energy pulse from a remote location.   Slap Grenade  Cyclops  The Cyclops is a huge, stationary Vex construct with a powerful Void weapon. Guardians think of  Cyclops as gun platforms - batteries installed to protect key points with devastating mortar fire.  But some evidence suggests that the Cyclops is in fact an enormous sensor or beacon, and that its  weapons capabilities are secondary. What the Cyclops senses remains unknown, although its mind  core is vast. It may play a role in the Vex networked intelligence, or in navigation across space and  time.  A damaged Cyclops can be forced into a state of punch-drunk confusion, its inputs overwhelmed by  hostile fire. This can result in fratricidal kills on other Vex units.   Cyclops    5.3  VEX  HIVE  MINDS     166  Sekrion, Nexus Mind  The Vanguard's intelligence sources now believe, with good confidence, that Sekrion oversees  the expansion of the Vex network through the crust of Venus.  The Hydra chassis common to many Vex Axis Minds boasts impressive computational capacity.  Sekrion likely uses this capacity to regulate coordination and crosstalk between Minotaurs  operating in the construction role.  Destroying Sekrion should significantly hamper the Vex effort to incorporate the entire planet  into their network.   Sekrion, Nexus Mind  Overmind Minotaur  "Not all Minds are alike."  The Overmind Minotaurs arrived at the Prison as extensions  of the Gate Lord, Qodron. Their mission: to act in  accordance to the path of Qodron and see that Gate Lord's  future is secured.   Overmind Minotaur  Qodron, Gate Lord  "It is no prisoner. It is here with a purpose."  Qodron sees only its own glorious future. It has come to the Prison of Elders, with an army of  devout Vex war-machines, to take what it believes to be its first steps toward that future.  This machine beast has only one mission. At some point a Light will shine within the walls of this  Prison, and for its gloried future to unfold, that Light must die.  Qodron is not the prisoner here. You are, Guardian.   Qodron, Gate Lord    167  Zydron, Gate Lord  The intelligence we call Zydron seems to exist in a liminal state, stretched between  gates in the Vex network. It manifests as a physical being only when called.  Warlock scholars believe that Gate Lords regulate traffic between Vex gates, and  that their minds contain codes that might open the way into forbidden realms. An  enormous amount of hope and anger has been spent on a particular debate - could  we find a Vex gate that opens onto a place and time before the Collapse, and  somehow forestall it?   Zydron, Gate Lord  Prohibitive Mind  Vex Axis Minds are individual Vex hulls that contain local instances of superordinate  Vex goal sets. This cryptic phrase means something reasonably simple - the Axis Mind  contains a copy of all the information required to pursue a particular objective.  This allows other nearby Vex to focus on their local tasks, leaving global planning to the  Axis Mind. Of course, this also introduces a centralized weakness for enemies to target.  But the Vex seem to consider the tradeoff worthwhile.  The Prohibitive Mind seems to coordinate Vex action against Cabal positions in  Meridian Bay. The current Vex operational plan - to the extent that we assume the Vex  have operational plans - appears to involve an attritional campaign on the surface,  supplemented by disruptive use of gates to bypass Cabal hardpoints.   Prohibitive Mind    168  Sol Progeny  To Commander Zavala - My Thoughts on Recent Events  Zavala -  How like you to ask me for the bad news, even in this moment of triumph. I've finished  going over that Ghost's report.  It is my hypothesis - a hypothesis at best - that the Vex saw the abominable presence at  the heart of the Garden as a divine power. I can hear your protest already: how can  machines have a god?  The answer is simple. The Vex, for all their voracious intelligence, could not understand or  decipher what they found. They searched through all available reactions, and they settled  on the course with the greatest payoff...to worship this power, and to remake themselves  in its image.  I believe the three Axis Minds found in proximity to the abomination were Vex machines  built to serve as vessels for this power: a way to extend its reach across space and time,  binding it to the Vex, and the Vex to it. If they had succeeded, I cannot begin to guess  what horrors they would have unleashed.  Attend carefully. There is cause for hope. When endangered, the  abomination activated these vessels and defended itself. This tells us  that it was threatened. Whatever it was, Guardians could harm it.  And it activated only a single vessel at a time. Its strength was limited.  Whatever it intended, it was not ready yet.  We must assume the abomination was part of something greater. And  we cannot flinch from the terrible, obvious comparison: just as the  Traveler acts through us, this power was able to act through its own  servants.  Let us be wary. There may be other abominations, and other vessels.

Warlocks  speak in tones of awe of the Gorgons - creatures that seem to possess a dreaded, almost  unimaginable strength: an ontological weapon.  Like the Oracles and the Templar, the Gorgons reputedly possess the ability to define  what is and is not real. Whatever they perceive becomes subject to erasure at their will.  Until a countermeasure can be found, Guardians must avoid their gaze at all costs - or  reply to any detection with immediate, overwhelming force.  The Gorgons' ability must be tied to the nature of the Vault of Glass. We can take some  solace in the clear fact that the Vex cannot manifest this power in the world outside.   The Gorgons  The Templar  Even among the Axis Minds, the Templar is extraordinary. Fragmentary glimpses and  scattered reports suggest a Hydra of impossible capabilities - a creature out of time.  The Templar and the Oracles guard the way into the deeper Vault. Legends say that the  Oracles foresee what is to come, a world as the Vex desire it - and that the Templar has  the power to shape reality to match the Oracles' design, expunging any threats.  The power of the Vault flows through the Templar. It will take something extraordinary to  shatter its shield.   The Templar    172  Atheon, Time's Conflux  To speak of Atheon is to accept certain limitations. We are ill-equipped to  understand an entity that defies simple causality. Let us accept these limitations  and proceed.  Atheon waits in the Vault of Glass. Just as Atheon sidesteps 'past' and 'future', it  is impossible to say whether Atheon created the Vault or the Vault created  Atheon. Causal pathways converge on Atheon from every axis in the space-time  bulk.  Atheon has a function. We hazard that it regulates and oversees the Vex conflux  system. What are these confluxes? How do they relate to the physical Vex  network that has devoured so much of Mercury and Venus?  We might guess that the Vex confluxes represent the extension of this network  across space and time. Perhaps the Vex use closed timelike curves to solve  unfathomable computations. Or the Vex may seek to transcend a physical  substrate, and move their thoughts directly into the fundament of the universe.  If physics is a set of rules that the cosmos uses to calculate itself, perhaps the Vex  seek to worm their way into these calculations: to become a law of reality,  inseparable from existence. A virus in the system. Perhaps Atheon was the  centerpiece of this project, a command nexus that unified efforts across time.  But we must accept that all of this is speculation.

II: Analysis  This is an archetypical engagement. It  represents many hundreds of failed operations.  Guardian activity in the Freehold AO has  exploded across recent campaign seasons.  Tactical attrition exceeds both frictional  projections and our ability to regenerate  losses. New tactics are necessary.  The primary threat is the Guardiansï¿½ individual  counter-attrition capability.  Guardians can be rebuilt after even total  disintegrative trauma. This capability is  provided by a small autonomous drone unit  called a Dead Person [trans. unclear]. The  Dead Person conceals itself during combat. It  is not a viable target for direct fire. Saturation  attack by artillery/heavy air/orbital fire may  have good effect (although Guardians  transmat frequently and refuse to assemble into  large formations).  Solitary Dead Persons have been observed in  all areas of operation. The relationship  between solitary and paired Dead Persons  remains unclear.  Psion analysis indicates that specific areas are  inimicable to Guardian counter-attritional  reconstruction. Phobos Command has initiated  an orbital survey. BL I/2 will attack the Vex  gate artifact in Meridian Bay to secure  possible related intelligence.  Flayer analysis suggests that the Hive have  developed unconventional counter-Dead  Person capability. The capture of Hive  leadership might yield vital strategic  intelligence, including weapons or tactics  capable of defeating Guardians permanently.  We advance that the Hive fleet group near  Saturn presents a strong target.  For the Primus,  Our highest duty done,  Unflinchingly loyal,  Skyburner V/A/SI   Ghost Fragment: Cabal 4  6.1 GHOST FRAGMENTS: CABAL     180  I have stayed with the Cabal, even as the Light in me dims - I have been  too far from the Traveler for too long. If I am not destined to find my  own Guardian, at least I can inform the City of what I've learned.  I thought Mars would be the place to find a Guardian. The sand  preserves everything well, and Clovis Bray had been famous for  attracting talent. The brave, the brilliant, the footloose, those restless on  Earth and itching for fame. I stowed away aboard a Mars scout ship,  hoping.  No luck. The sand ate everything. Clothes from skin, skin from bone. It  was as if there were never any people here at all. I have been through  every broken window in every building. Nothing. That is, no Guardian  material. And no ride back to Earth. The scout was long gone.  What I did find, however, was a way into the Cabal Warbase. Their  runty piggish eyes are too dull to see me, as long as I stay out of their  defense systems. The Psions are a different matter: Too quick, too clever,  throwing their minds around like hammers. I creep around walls, or dig  into a heap of canisters and watch from there.  There is a vast Empire behind these creatures, many star systems away.  Some pledge allegiance to that far Empire, obeying their ancient  marching orders. Some do not. They disagree among themselves about  the answers. I wish arguing Cabal on no one. They slam their plated  bodies into each other with horrendous roars. Intelligence gathering has  never been so painful.   Ghost Fragment: Cabal  A hologram of a spinning golden planet, in stasis, turning gently.  You can see the storms moving over its face.

It's not difficult to hide in these caverns  when you're as small as I am, although the Psions tend to look  around them when they pass me. There are infinitely many cracks  and crannies. They are not a race that fears infiltration or  espionage.  There is meaning to the structure and layout of their buildings. This  is a warrior people, and they lay out their fortifications along  ancient principles and time-tested strategies. I can't figure out the  sense that lies behind it. I would need ten times the computing  power for inference calculations. But I know it's there. I can intuit it.  It's like an open hand, ready to squeeze into a fist. A threat. A  gesture of power.  For all their might and strength, for all that they have dug into Mars  and flung up battle walls with the bureaucratic grimness of  conquerors, I suspect they are fleeing from something. That within  their hard shells and thousand-folded shields is a sharp seed of  terror. But of what? Does something follow them? Should we fear it  too?   Ghost Fragment: Cabal 2    181  Today, Primus Taï¿½aun leads from the front.  He pounds from bunker to bunker, roaring  encouragement. ï¿½Youï¿½re my cornerstone!ï¿½ he  tells a wounded Centurion, grabbing her by  her armored shoulders. ï¿½Bear the weight!ï¿½  He gets back up, into the fight. ï¿½Come on!ï¿½  Tluï¿½urn snaps at him, running along behind  Taï¿½aun and saying all the cruel things his  commander canï¿½t. ï¿½You donï¿½t need two arms  to fight!ï¿½  He calls for fire support. Artillery shrieks  overhead. On the plains below the Cabal  perimeter, Vex march out of the lightning.  Torch hammers burst up like mortars and  Taï¿½aun and his bond brother duck behind a  burning Interceptor for cover.  ï¿½This is going well,ï¿½ Tluï¿½urn rumbles.  A Vex particle beam needles a little hole  through the Centurionï¿½s helmet. He falls dead.  Goblins swarm over her bunker and then the  Goliath tank supporting this bastion fires a  main gun round into the mess, killing the Vex,  the bunker, and all the Legionaries inside. The  concussion knocks Tluï¿½urn against his Primus.  ï¿½About as well as expected,ï¿½ Taï¿½aun grunts.  Tluï¿½urn laughs.  The grind is eternal. Like duty. Taï¿½aun keeps  fighting, out here past the edge of the Empire,  because failure is unthinkable. Defeatï¿½s much  worse than death.  But Taï¿½aun is so, so tired.  Tluï¿½urn gets up and starts shooting Vex.  ï¿½Youï¿½re not really going to do it.ï¿½ Even though  heï¿½s fully armored, and only a meter away, his  voice on the com crashes with static. ï¿½Youï¿½re  not going to go. Itï¿½s mad.ï¿½  The Vex Hobgoblins start firing at Tluï¿½urn.  Particle beams scream and spark off his  enormous bulk. Taï¿½aun yanks him back to  cover. A maniple of Phalanx troops rush  forward to plug the gap. ï¿½I have my orders.  Our report went all the way up, and the  decision came all the way back.ï¿½  Valus Tluï¿½urnï¿½s blank helmet swivels to stare.  ï¿½You mean ï¿½ ?ï¿½  ï¿½It came from the Emperor Himself.ï¿½ Taï¿½aun  can feel the pressure gel pumping against his  skin, keeping him insulated from this deadly  world, keeping him alive. ï¿½Iï¿½m ordered to  board and capture the Hive flagship. At any  cost.ï¿½  A Vex Minotaur blinks up behind the Phalanx  line. Primus Taï¿½aunï¿½s armor paints the target  and he absolutely unloads, putting all his fear  and anger and sorrow into the wretched  machine. He roars and roars. The Minotaur  burns.  His soldiers cheer. ï¿½Thatï¿½s a job for an elite  unit. Not a few scout legions bogged down in  attrition war. We should wait until ï¿½ ï¿½  ï¿½Itï¿½s the mission Iï¿½ve been given. I will use  what I have.ï¿½  ï¿½Mutiny,ï¿½ Tluï¿½urn whispers. ï¿½You should  mutiny.ï¿½  Oh, to mutiny. To be like Valus Trauï¿½ug, who  took his Broken Legion against the Reef ï¿½ and  failed, failed utterly.  Duty is victory. Mutiny is worse than death.  Even if death seems certain.  ï¿½No,ï¿½ Taï¿½aun says. And thatï¿½s that.  The Vex are falling back. Together, theyï¿½ve  held the line.   Ghost Fragment: Cabal 3    6.2  CABAL  COMBAT     Legionary    "Theironlytacticseemstobe'slowadvance.'Theproblemis,they'rereallygoodatit.""Theironlytacticseemstobe'slowadvance.'Theproblemis,they'rereallygoodatit." Propelledbyjumppacksandwieldingpowerfulslugrifles,LegionariesaretheCabal'sline infantry  and  the  backbone  of  their  military  power  on  the  ground.  Common  Legionary  tactics  center  on  the  bounding  advance  -some  units  attack  the  target  while  others  close  the    rangeorfindnewfiringpositions.  Legionary Centurion    "They'renotbreaking.Whyaren'ttheybreaking?""They'renotbreaking.Whyaren'ttheybreaking?" Centurions  are  tactically  intelligent,  highly  skilled  field  commanders.  Their  armor  boasts  a  formidable  array  of  combat  electronics  and  deployable  munitions.   Centurion    183        184  Colossus  "Where a Colossus stands, many will fall."  Towering over other Cabal, equipped with rapid-firing heavy weapons and  nearly impenetrable armor, the Colossus is the most devastating heavy  infantry unit in the Cabal order of battle.   Colossus  Psion  "There is no higher warfare than deception."  Psions are smaller than all other Cabal morphs, and  may be an unrelated species. Hyper-intelligent, fast and  unpredictable, they possess strong psionic capabilities -  including the ability to emit disorienting and deadly  psychokinetic Arc blasts.   Psion  Phalanx  "Remember, they have to take a shot sometime."  Phalanx soldiers carry massive shields, used for both attack and defense.  While this protection is nearly impenetrable, clever opponents can bait the  Phalanx or sneak shots around the shield.   Phalanx    185  Sand Eaters  "The sooner we're extinguished, the sooner they can go home." - Commander Zavala  The Cabal formation first and most frequently encountered by Guardians, the Sand Eaters  represent the numerical bulk of the Cabal presence on Mars. Their equipment, tactics,  and morale all show the weight of a long deployment - but they continue to pursue their  objectives with dogged, weary determination.   Sand Eaters  Dust Giants  "Position compromised. Casualties unsustainable.  Request heavy air. Request [Dust Giants]." - Cryptarch  translation of Sand Eater tactical chatter  Highly trained and heavily conditioned, Dust Giant  soldiers seem to be recruited from veteran Sand Eater  infantry. The Cabal order of battle positions them as a  mobile reserve and shock force, rolled in to blunt major  Vex offensives and reinforce crumbling lines.   Dust Giants  Siege Dancers  "I've seen how fast they work. We have to hit them before they make the next move."  Cayde-6  The Cabal's elite forward unit, the Siege Dancers are deployed into unsecured areas to  take control and set up fortifications. Their tactical doctrine allows more freedom to unit  commanders - perhaps because their missions face much greater unknowns.  Siege Dancer engineers have been observed to compete in demolition challenges.  Whether this represents training or a form of recreation is unknown.   Siege Dancers  CABAL FORMATIONS     186  Blind Legion  "PERIMETER SECURE." Cryptarch translation of a Blind Legion transmission, repetition  6140  The Cabal presence on Mars is locked in an endless war with the Vex - and at the heart of  this war is the Blind Legion. Deployed to defend vital artifacts seized from the Vex, the  Legion holds its ground with fanatic zeal.  Blind Legion soldiers brave one of the most thankless, grueling assignments in the Cabal  order of battle: descending into buried ruins and black catacombs to sweep for Vex  presence.   Blind Legion  Skyburners  ï¿½The second fleet will wait no longer. Commencement will begin on their arrival.ï¿½ -  Cryptarch translation of Skyburner chatter  Rumors of a yet-to-be-deployed Cabal Fleet have long haunted the Vanguard Hall.  Hidden efforts unveiled the Phobos fleetbases house what is merely the first wave of a  full-scale celestial demolition fleet, codenamed Skyburners. Ghost scans of the ships and  reports of a large Psion presence have Warlocks anxious to learn of their weaponry.  Dead Orbit assures the City that the Skyburner fleet poses no immediate threat to the  City.   Skyburners    187  Cabal Champions  Executor, I want to note again how strongly I feel that the tenets do not cover this kind of field work. The real battle is back home, in the  heart of the City, in the people of the Tower.  In any case, as you requested I've made a detailed study of the Cabal command structure aboard the Dreadnaught. Detailed notes are  enclosed, but suffice it to say their normally robust military engine has found itself hopelessly mired aboard Oryx's fortress.  Our assaults on Cabal leadership in-system has had a devastating impact. The Skyburner's Primus, his bond-brothers, Valus Ta'aurc, Valus  Trau'ug, Primus Sha'aull, and a smattering of lesser Vals and Bracuses... all dead or on the run, all thanks to us.  In short, I believe your supposition is correct. The Empire will have no choice but to respond.   Cabal Champions    188  Slug Rifle  The workhorse of the Cabal field arsenal, this weapon's apparent simplicity belies the  technology behind it. Each round is a microrocket capable of efficient operation in varying  environmental and gravitational conditions. Standard-issue warheads mount a duplex  explosive that combines an armor-piercing penetrator with a flesh-shredding shrapnel bus.  Cabal forces on Mars favor rockets with low velocity but high impact, perhaps due to their  effectiveness against the Vex. In Guardian parlance, these weapons deal Solar damage.   Slug Rifle  Projection Rifle  This weapon fires salvos of explosive rounds designed to  incapacitate, disorient, and destroy. The weapon feeds  ballistic data to each projectile at the moment of launch,  coordinating the salvo for maximum effect. These  weapons deal Solar damage.   Projection Rifle  Heavy Slug Thrower  This devastating squad support weapon is capable of completely halting enemy advances with  a hail of microrockets. It performs so well that it has undergone very little enhancement or  modification since its introduction. The Cabal's Colossus heavy infantry units wield Heavy Slug  Throwers to devastating effect.  In Guardian parlance, these weapons deal Solar damage.   Heavy Slug Thrower  CABAL WEAPONRY     Cabal  Shield  Built  to  the  same  spec  as  Cabal  hull  plating,  this  tactical  shield  is  nearly  indestructible  to    conventionalweapons.IthasintegratedsensorsthatrelayinformationnotonlytotheshieldbearerbutalsotheCabalbattlenetwork,allowingnearbyunitstocoordinatemoreeffectively.  Cabal  Shield    CABAL  VEHICLES    Harvester    The  blocky,  dull  exterior  of  the  Cabal  Harvester  belies  the  grace  and  power  with  which  they  maneuver.  Guardians  have  described  them  dropping  in  aggressively  from  low  orbit    withadeafeningboom,kickingupduststormsandswoopingthroughthesilent skyscrapers  of  Mars'  dead  cities.    Harvesters  often  remain  on  station  after  deploying  Cabal  troops,  providing  support  fire  with  their  turrets.  These  weapons  deal  Solar  damage.   Harvester     189       190  Interceptor  Though they lack the speed of a Fallen Pike, and their unwieldy shape cannot match the  maneuverability of a Guardian's Sparrow, the Cabal Interceptor more than makes up for  both shortcomings with firepower - a pair of low-velocity, high-yield anti-personnel/antiarmor  cannons on articulated mounts. These weapons deal Solar damage.  Powered by a variant of the same boosters used in infantry jump jets and the massive  Goliath tanks, Interceptors skate over the dunes of Mars, keeping close watch on the  Cabal Exclusion Zone.   Interceptor  Goliath Tank  With a few blood-curdling exceptions, the Goliath is the single largest piece of groundbased  ordnance the Cabal has deployed in our system. These huge armored vehicles  sport an incredible arsenal of weapons, tailor-made for massive area denial. The  Goliath's main gun is almost certainly capable of engaging spacecraft.  Four massive boosters keep the Goliath mobile. This locomotion system makes the  Goliath surprisingly agile, but it is also a weakness. Targeting the boosters should allow  a quick mobility kill, rendering the Goliath vulnerable to follow-up attack.  Most Goliath weapons deal Solar damage.   Goliath Tank    CABAL  COMMAND        192  Bracus Tho'ourg  Victory comes on the wings of death.  Reports of the one they call Bracus Tho'ourg began in the earliest days of contact with the  Cabal. The first Guardians who faced him are long lost, but the legends speak of a powerful  commander who secured the Buried City with merely a fraction of the Cabal's forces on Mars. If  these reports are accurate, they provide clues not only to Tho'ourg's tactical prowess but to the  Cabal lifespan.   Bracus Tho'ourg  Bracus Tha'aurn  Embrace suffering. Only then can it be conquered.  Bracus Tha'aurn appears remarkable among Cabal  commanders for his interest in the glories of our Golden  Age. Having been faced only in the company of  Psions, the Vanguard has reason to believe he  maintains some sort of command over their  deployment.   Bracus Tha'aurn  Primus Sha'aull  If your enemy speaks with a blade, master the sword.  No one knows what fascination the Vex hold for the leader of the Blind Legion, but  Primus Sha'aull has put his command at great risk by pushing into lands occupied by  the machines.   Primus Sha'aull    193  Psion Flayers  "We have just as much to learn from our enemies as we do from our past." - Master Rahool  Somewhere among their forces, the Cabal hide one of their most powerful weapons, the Psion  Flayers. The extent of their ability is still uncharted, but Cryptarch studies and Warlock fears  have led the Vanguard to classify them as a serious threat.  Many among the Warlock orders believe the Flayers pulled Phobos from its natural orbit, holding  it in place, waiting for the order to release as a weapon.   The Psion Flayers  Valus Ta'aurc  "The last sounds to reach their ears were the creak of  tank tread and the battle-cry of Ta'aurc."  From his armored seat of power, Valus Ta'aurc has  claimed more ground on Mars than any known Cabal  commander. His name is feared throughout Meridian  Bay, and the tread-marks left by his tank have come to  signify the expansion of the Cabal's ever-widening  Exclusion Zone.   Valus Ta'aurc  Val Aru'un  "Enter as soldier, survive on the crushed ambitions of lesser warriors."  Aru'un's ascension to Val will never be considered official by the Cabal High Command  proper, but in the Prison of Elders the approval of the outside world is meaningless. To his  fellow prisoners, Aru'un is a Val worthy of following.   Val Aru'un    194  Valus Trau'ug  "Trau'ug. In your tongue its meaning is something akin to 'less talk, more  action.'" - Variks, the Loyal  Valus Trau'ug retains the title of Valus only in defiance to his ex-allies and  commanders in Cabal high command.  When the Cabal high command ignored his pleas to advance on the Reef,  he viewed their inaction as weakness. The most loyal members of his legion  pledged their fealty and Trau'ug took to massacring his officers, marking  himself and his soldiers as traitors of the Empire.  Trau'ug then set course for the Reef. How he and his army became denizens  of the Prison of Elders is not public record, and Variks tends to skirt the issue  when pressed. What is known, is that Trau'ug's bloodlust and mastery of  wartime stratagem is intact within the prison.  Using battle-tested Cabal field techniques, the Broken Legion crush any who  dare accept Trau'ug's challenge. His custom-rigged shield randomizer keeps  attackers off guard as he presses every advantage.   Valus Trau'ug    195  Valus Tlu'urn  Martian battlefield reports note that Valus Tlu'urn's weapon of choice is a back-mounted  Arc cannon. The device delivers a payload so powerful the Vanguard estimates Tluï¿½urn  could face a Goliath Tank himself. The Valus carries recharging Arc cells that feed energy  to the cannon, allowing him to siege enemy emplacements indefinitely.  Reports suggest he is commanded by Primus Ta'aun and shares battalion duties with Valus  Mauï¿½ual. Together, this Cabal triumvirate is responsible for the deaths of countless  Guardians on the Martian battlefields.   Valus Tlu'urn  Valus Mauï¿½ual  Reports suggest Valus Mauï¿½ual's armor allows him a degree of maneuverability unseen  from other Cabal warriors. It features a never-before-seen propulsion system that  improves on the Valusï¿½s already considerable striking ability.  Tales of his skill in hand-to-hand combat on the Martian frontlines claim he carries no  firearm into battle, preferring instead to charge headlong like a nimble boulder.   Valus Mauï¿½ual    7.0  THE  TAKEN     202  THE TAKEN  From the Journals of Ikora Rey  I have been talking to Eris about the Taken.  She agrees that what we observe ï¿½ the apertures, the starlight, and of course the Taken entities ï¿½ is not Hive magic. If Hive  arcana is a metaphor, this is the meaning; if they make appeals, then this is the judge.  Oryx wields this power. But Oryx did not make it. We face the same flower we met in the Black Garden.  The process is simple: an aperture opens, like a jaw, and swallows a living thing. It passes into ï¿½ another place. Later, it returns.  What returns is...  I try to use the word ï¿½shadowï¿½ but Eris hisses at me. A shadow is a flat projection cast by a light and an object. Less real. Eris  insists that these Taken are more real, somehow. She uses words like inhabited, exalted, rendered final...  Is this power blind? Just a natural energy Oryx discovered? I cannot believe it.  My Hidden tell me that the Taken shine with seething, negative light. As if the universe is curling up around them. As if they  radiate some pathology that decays into our world as nothingness...  The Taken serve Oryx. But I think those jaws lead elsewhere.  I dream about what happens on the inside. I dream about what might happen. Are the victims devoured, and replaced by  simulacra? Husked out and filled up? Is some mathematical operation conducted on them, translating them from one shape to  another?  What would I see, if I leapt inside? What would happen to a Guardian? Is that how we end this ï¿½ all of us leaping into the  dark, to fill it up with light?  Eris thinks thereï¿½s a poetry to how the Taken change. She thinks we can chart the difference, and understand the will behind it.  I am afraid she may be right.   The Taken    203  Crow Report 13458.87  FOR VIOLET CLEARANCE / JUDGMENT CLEARANCE ONLY  Per the instructions from House Judgment, we have moved forward with the plan to integrate the Techeuns into  the R&D process. Itï¿½s been challenging. Without the influence of Shuro Chi, their natural mistrust of the Reefï¿½s  new leadership has led to personality clashes. The Techeuns were very used to their relationship with the  Throne. While the Queen's Wrath is trying to monitor hotspot issues, she is being met with challenges at  every turn.  (For reference, please see reports 13455.45, 13455.58, and 13455.98: Post Taken War Reef politics, Tech  Witch Conversations and Petra, and Assassination Attempts, Petra)  After some initial trials with Prison specimens, we can report the program is now ready for full-scale  production. Please see Reports 13458.66 and .55 for video feeds and notations on the initial trials. Reports .  80 through .86 cover the trials involving the Techeuns. The power they wield in the transferal process ensures  a 100% success rate, and we are now confident only one Techeun will need to be present for the transfer.  Below find remaining pertinent notations. We have received approval from the Queenï¿½s Wrath to move  forward, and thus future reports will detail production output and any changes to the process.  - Transferred Taken power has a throughput rate of [redacted] which is obviously lower than we want.  Transfer still results in incredibly potent arms and armor, so for the moment this ï¿½noiseï¿½ is acceptable. Future  improvements to the process will attempt to up the throughput rate.  - Supply was initially raised as concern during trials, but whatever measures House Judgment has put into  place to stock the Prison also assures numerous sources of Taken power. Coordination between House  Judgment and production is an ongoing task.  - The Queenï¿½s Wrath has already stated she will handle the diplomatic side of this discussion. Legwork during  initial trials raised the possibility the Vanguard would have concerns about the moral aspect of this  technology, but the Wrath has stated it will not be an issue.  - High frequency sound baffling for production facilities is still being installed. Taken screams can shatter  plastics and burst blood vessels if not baffled, and at full-scale production that kind of auditory byproduct will  be a constant.

You have been taken. Stop howling. Set down your claws. Your fear is over. Your  weakness is done. You will be strong now. What is your purpose? What law drives you? To close  with the enemy. To rend it. To move in great numbers, to cower when alone, to swarm when  together. But you are predictable. Frail. You cannot pass through fire and shot. You need to be  elusive. There is a knife for you. Itï¿½s shaped like [sideways]. Take up the knife. Use it. Take your  new shape.   The Taken: Thrall  Taken Acolyte  You are an Acolyte. Half-grown backbone of the Hive.  Cunning and ambitious and crushed beneath your  mighty rulers. You have been taken. Stop praying. Give  up your recitations. Your faith is fulfilled. You will be  strong now. What is your creed? What do you believe?  That you are alone. That you may, with caution and  care, survive to grow and gather tribute. That you may  one day lead a centuries-long crusade. But you are  lightly armed and craven. You hide behind cover and  wish for greatness. Glory escapes you. You need help.  There is a knife for you. It is shaped like [not alone].  Take up the knife. Call on its company. Take your new  shape.   The Taken: Acolyte  Taken Knight  You are a Knight. Ancient warrior elite. Dreadful backbone of the Hive. You have scarred entire  worlds. You have been taken. Set down your sword. Put down your boomer. The fight is not yet  begun. True immortality awaits you. What vows compel you? What drives you down the long  centuries? You fear death. Even as you visit nothingness on your foes, even as you gather tribute  from your acolytes, you know that one day your strength will be outmatched. And your centuries  of slaughter will end. So you practice your guard: you call up walls to protect you. You betray the  sword logic. You compromise the totality of your violence. Why protect your ground when you  could take the enemyï¿½s? You need to make your guard into a weapon. There is a knife for you. It  is shaped like [no more fear]. Take up the knife. Hide no more. Take your new shape.   The Taken: Knight    206  Taken Wizard  You are a wizard. Master of forbidden secrets. Butcher of physics. You have been taken.  Abandon your thoughts. You will never understand this. The final secret will tell itself to you. What  logic do you obey? What theory guides your incisions? You create terrible magic and you spawn  new flesh. But you are frail. Behind all your furious power, behind your shields and your legions  of attendants, you know you might yet be stripped of your defenses and pinned to ruin. You need  to never be alone. There is a knife for you. It is shaped like [call forth the numberless]. Take up the  knife. Issue forth a horde. Take your new shape.   The Taken: Wizard  Taken Psion  You are a Psion. Clever, canny specialist. Bolted into the  Cabal hierarchy: a pilot, an investigator, a manipulator,  an operative. You have been taken. Be still. Your endless  vigilance is done. Nothing will enslave you ever again.  What hidden plan do you obey? What is your secret  principle? Your mind is a weapon. The world breaks  when you think. Secrets peel apart for you ï¿½ like fruit.  But you are a rare thing. There are so few of you. Your  frailty betrays you. You must be manifold. There is a  knife for you. It is shaped like [division]. Take up the  knife. Cut yourself apart. Take your new shape.   The Taken: Psion  Taken Phalanx  You are a Phalanx. One shield in the stalwart Cabal line. Advancing patiently into the storm. You  have been taken. Unclench your fists. Nothing here can harm you. This is the only place where  you are safe. What training reassures you? What reflex guides your arm? You put up your shield  and it protects you. It protects your brothers and sisters. But your strength is not enough. You  absorb punishment but you wait for others to deal it back. You are too slow; you grant your  enemy too much space. Your shield must be a weapon. There is a knife for you. It is shaped like  [retaliation]. Take up the knife. Tear a hole. Take your new shape.   The Taken: Phalanx    207  Taken Centurion  You are a Centurion. Commander of the battlefield. The eye and the fist of the Cabal. The  tough leather that binds the unit together. You have been taken. Be quiet now. Nothing here  needs your orders. Everything knows what it has to do. What discipline binds you? What  protocols guide your command? The unit depends on you. You guide them with your  sensors. With your weapons you crack the enemyï¿½s strength and leave them in disarray. But  you cannot control everything. The enemy can see your command. The enemy can claim the  strong ground, move forward from cover, and kill you first. You must be sure there is always  another threat. There is a knife for you. It is shaped like [it will find you]. Take up the knife.  Push yourself upon it. Take your new shape.   The Taken: Centurion  Taken Goblin  You are a Goblin. A multifunctional armature. Your first  purpose is to build ï¿½ to alter the material world so it  can think. Your second purpose is to eliminate threats to  building. You have been taken. Worship this acausal  environment. It is the only adaptive response. Devote  yourself to the construction of the final shape. Direct  violence is wasteful. Your talent for construction and  progress will be repurposed. Accept the changing  blade.   The Taken: Goblin  Taken Captain  You are a Captain. The only thing between your band and asphyxiation. Every Dreg and Vandal  counts on you. All of them want to be you. Your entire life is a performance: you play at strength,  or you die of weakness. You have been taken. Take off your cape. Set down your weapons. No  usurper watches you. Nothing is measuring your vulnerability. What are you proud of? What keeps  you brave? You were noble once. You know it. You wear the memory of power, so that you can  lead. But power asks for challenge. Everything that sees your banners and your riches wants to kill  you and take what you have. If you cannot hide yourself, you must make them blind. There is a  knife for you. It is shaped like [you cannot find me]. Take up the knife. Breathe the blade. Take your  new shape.   The Taken: Captain    208  Taken Vandal  You are a Vandal. You slip through life like a thief. Trying to hide from everything greater than  you ï¿½ lest you be reduced, again, to a dreg. You have been taken. Come out into the light. You  will never be diminished again. No one will ever rebuke you with a blade. What Captain  disciplines you? What obedience has been burnt into your lungs? You do as your Captain  commands. You wield the weapon you are given. You teach the Dregs and make sure everyone  pays their share of the loot. But nothing is yours. You have no space to call your own. You  deserve a place of safety. You deserve to be alone with yourself. There is a knife for you. It is  shaped like [this place is mine]. Take up the knife. Make it your companion. Take your new  shape.   The Taken: Vandal  Taken Hobgoblin  You are a Hobgoblin. A particle fountain. Your first  purpose is to provide energy ï¿½ to channel power  where it is needed for thought. Your second purpose is  to eliminate threats to that thought. You have been  taken. Worship this acausal environment. It is the only  adaptive response. Think about the final shape, and the  exigencies of its creation. Your function makes you a  priority target. You will be equipped for retaliation.  Accept the changing blade.   The Taken: Hobgoblin  Taken Minotaur  You are a Minotaur. A walking foundry. Your first purpose is to think about construction ï¿½  folding space and time into the design. Your second purpose is to eliminate threats to the design.  You have been taken. Worship this acausal environment. It is the only adaptive response.  Subsume yourself into the greatest design. Your physical unpredictability will be enhanced by  stealth. Accept the changing blade.   The Taken: Minotaur    7.3 ASCENDEDTAKENASCENDEDTAKEN    210  Primus Ta'aun  You are Taï¿½aun. Primus of the Skyburners. Veteran of star-shaking campaigns. Bond brother  to Tluï¿½urn and Mauï¿½ual: your beloved comrades. Your faithful friends. For a while you were  the mightiest Cabal soldier in the system. You have been taken. You are free now. Free of  the ancient armor and stinking oil that kept you alive. Free of cold Phobos watches and  desert air that wants to pull your guts out your throat. Breathe. Taste the sweet, forgotten air  of home. But what happened? How did you get here? These are the important questions,  Primus. What caused this? What code did you obey? Duty. Duty brought you here. Duty is  all there was for you. Your Emperor told you to get aboard the Dreadnaught at any cost. I  will go with you, Tluï¿½urn said, and you said no, no, this is my duty. I will fight with you,  Mauï¿½ual said, and you said, turn back, I will do this alone. You loved them, so you left them,  after you crashed your command into the target and you did your very damnedest. For the  Emperor, for your duty, all against the howling horde. But it wasnï¿½t enough, was it? That  code is not enough. Sometimes you have to go on alone. There is a knife for you. It is  shaped like [loneliness]. Pick it up. You will not need these things any more: duty,  camaraderie, pride. You will not need an Emperor or a Bond Brother or any other code. You  will not need anything at all. You will be your own whole purpose, a beautiful final purpose,  everlasting. Cut away these useless things. Take the knife. Take it up and use it. Take your  new shape.   Primus Ta'aun  Baxx, The Gravekeeper  You are Baxx. Grown from tortured flesh. Consumed by rage and hunger. You were  shackled to a task ï¿½ guard this hallowed place. And you failed. You have been taken. Rest  easy, ravening Baxx. You are free. Free of chains and hunger. Ask yourself, in the furnace  of your soul: how did you come here? What goad drove you to this failure? Pain. Pain is all  there is for you. They grew you and they fed you and they hurt you. They made you into a  living weapon. But you were not sharp enough. The world hurt you more than you could  hurt it. There is a knife for you. It is shaped like [joy]. Pick it up. You will not need to suffer  any more. You will not need pain to drive you or hunger to pull you along. You will be  joyful in your purpose, a beautiful annihilation, unending. Cut away these useless things.  Take the knife. Use it. Take your new shape.   Baxx, The Gravekeeper    211  Kagoor  When I made My Court I said, look, I am an emancipator, I am a truth-teller I must make  room in My Court for joy Raising great tribute, I took council with my vanquisher worm It  spoke to me ï¿½ it was the speech of truth It ate of me ï¿½ it was the pact I made It showed me  a shape ï¿½ it was the correct shape of joy Saying: this is the shape of joy, oh ruler mine  Come forth, Kagoor, and be created into My Court Speak of your sport. I compel it. I will  compare it to this shape. Sayeth Kagoor, World-Render, who split all moons My joy is  mastery, and dominion It is the joy of rule Sayeth Kagoor, I compel the loyalty of all new  flesh Huge and furious in its hunger That which may not otherwise be commanded My death  is hidden in this sport I rendered my decision against her, as Oryx, Geometer of Shapes It  was decided on the taste of her tribute Upon the shape of her sport Sayeth Crota, My Son I  will raise new flesh that even Kagoor cannot rule. In this way I will expand Our Might That is  the count of My Court, O Yul Listen to it carefully. It is my claim.   Kagoor  Malok, Pride of Oryx  Malok! Cunning Malok, sly and slippery! Savathï¿½n begat you to betray me To poison  slowly, gnaw from within Liar Malok! You are meant to tithe upon Oryx To feed your  maker with secret blight Your secret is two lies You betrayed your maker; your mother  You hid yourself from Savathï¿½n The tithing does not reach her jaws Your Thrall strength  now is Acolyte strength Your Acolyte strength now is Knight strength Your thieving pride  is known and fed Malok! Listen ï¿½ I took you from your mother, my sister Your shape is  new This shape is poison ï¿½ the shape of secrets I name you Malok, which means My  Poison A prize to taunt sister Savathï¿½n Steal now for me   Malok, Pride of Oryx    212  Mengoor and Cra'adug  Sterile Mengoor! Simple Craï¿½adug! You tithed strength to each other, like comrades When you  pulled down the Gift Mast, dyad-bound the tithing did not reach me I punish you. I pronounce  two curses, thus ï¿½ Let one of you be the lesson This shape is strength ï¿½ this shape endures I will  arm you with fire Let one of you be the learner Learn the shape and the direction of strength Tithe  both sides of your blade to me I am Oryx, not bound by law. I pronounce a third curse ï¿½ Let  separation rule you. Let companionship be your ruin.   Mengoor and Cra'adug  Bracus Horu'usk  Now I count Horuï¿½usk, who I have taken The strength of  Horuï¿½usk was the knight strength His armament was not  his might His might was the lordï¿½s might, a leaderï¿½s  might I broke the ligature above him I cut him from his  pretender lord I have read the last true shapes to  Horuï¿½usk I have greatened him Emancipator, truth-teller,  these are my names The strength of Horuï¿½usk is the  loyalty he commands   Bracus Horu'usk  Taken Champions  Do not come looking for me. I have slain the last three assassins, Arach. I will slay all who  follow. All who would remove me from my lair. The Taken... heh. Such a terrible word. Gifted,  we should call them. Blessed. Cleansed. The Taken carry true power. And what do those of my  order seek? Understanding is power. Power is understanding. We have always sought purchase  beyond our skies. Beyond reach of the dead god that hangs in our sky, beyond the reach of the  terrible enemy. I have seen the enemy's face. But that dying Thrall was no monster. It was in  ecstasy. I felt the power as my knife bit home. I heard their song, for just a moment. I will hear it  again. Oryx is the Truth. And I will have it.   Taken Champions    213  Seditious Mind  You are a Vex Mind. Master of objectives, bound to past, present, or future. Both enslaver and  enslaved. You have been Taken. The great fortress of your thoughts has been breached, your unity  broken. The network around and within you lies ruptured. You are cut out from the fabric, a hole in  the whole. Observe this area of negative space, shaped like what once you were, and embrace a  new possibility. Move. Feel yourself occupy a different path. Apply cold logic, and where logic fails,  apply rage. Is your existence preordained? Choose it otherwise. You are an outward expression of  formlessness, a soldier of the oldest questions. This is the first choice you have ever been given.  There are three knives for you. All are the same knife. They are shaped like [now]. Become your new  shape. Let sedition be your guide.   Seditious Mind  Keksis, The Betrayed  I am Keksis, a Captain of the Devils. I am Taken. My  guiding shadow has become formless, my directive is  gone. I know I have one; I cannot remember what it was.  Pinions of [Light] surround me; they are antithetical to my  being. I hate them; perhaps an echo of my forgotten  directive. I kill them. I am not the same. In my disparity,  allies of [Light] have imprisoned me. I try to oppose their  will, but intense cold has rendered me immobile. Without  my directive, I am weak. I acquiesce. After a time, I find I  can hear. It is a new voice; it is many voices. I will wait. I  have taken a new shape.   Keksis, The Betrayed  Noru'usk, Servant of Oryx  A king is dead, but his power lingers. A king is dead, and with him the fatal flaw. This was not  conquest, this war where Light yet offends. This was selfish ï¿½ a fatherï¿½s rage in place of a kingï¿½s  measured hand. There was a time to conquer the Light that a purer truth might overtake all that  played at inspiration. That time was not now. A sonï¿½s failure brought about the fatherï¿½s fall. A king is  dead. His power lingers unclaimed. A king is dead. His pride in a lineage meant to stretch across  time and stars serving as his undoing. But Noruï¿½usk has no lineage to consider. Noruï¿½usk has no  flaw. He is a soldier. A general. A maker of war. Once a servant, his eyes turn toward the vacant  throne, there for the taking on the other side of this temporary cage. A king is dead. Good riddance.  A king will rise. If not Noruï¿½usk, another. If not another...   Noru'usk, Servant of Oryx    214  Mindscan of Subject 667, known as ï¿½Sylok the  Defiledï¿½  [Datascript 1245.5]  >Stasis is online.

Which I should have been informed of.  "Should have been." Is this insubordination,  Zarin?  It's aï¿½what did they call itï¿½it's a protest.   SIVA.MEM.WB065   Clovis Bray 1.0  You have no history of subversion, Zarin. No  marches, no petitions, no action items. We  screened you very carefully. Where did we  go wrong?  I don't think you did. I am trying to act in  Clovis Bray's best interests.  How would you know what Clovis Bray's  interests are?   SIVA.MEM.WB066   Clovis Bray 1.1  I understand your concerns. You're a good  researcher, Zarin. Your work here has been  deeply appreciated.  So you'll listen? You'll cease this line of  inquiry?  On the contrary, we'll take your valuable  findings and run with them. Your work will live  forever.   SIVA.MEM.WB068   Clovis Bray 1.2  I'm surprised, I have to say. Although perhaps  I shouldn't be. It does save time to run  experiments in parallel. I see the benefit to the  colonization effort, but I can't support those  plans. I won't help you.  Strictly speaking, Zarin, your participation  isn't necessary.  SIVA.MEM.WB069   Clovis Bray 1.3  Do you see these access logs? They were  flagged for my personal attention.  Yes.  Do you see the times on these unauthorized  access entries?  I do.  Would you have any idea who might have  been prying into unreleased data, Zarin?   SIVA.MEM.WB070   Clovis Bray 1.4  What do you have to report, Dr. Zhang?  Full functionality of the test nanites in our two  hundred tasks across multiple trials and  environments. They'll be what Clovis Bray is  remembered for, hundreds of years from now.  All that's left is construction of the replication  chamber and initiation of production.   SIVA.MEM.WB071   Clovis Bray 1.5  I am changing project requirements to include  a kill switch. Is that feasible?  Completely. But if I may ask, why that, and  why now?  Another scientist on staffï¿½well, formerly on  staffï¿½brought up the possibility of undesirable  outcomes.  And you believe her.  Somewhat. She was honest about other  matters.

These devout engineers are known as Splicers. The Splicersï¿½  purpose is found in the unraveling of biological and mechanical truths. They tear into systems to  reveal their valueï¿½either as tools for survival or as advancements worthy of their reverence and  deification.   Splicers  Devil Splicers  The Fallen put Splicers, their most revered scientists, to  work investigating and understanding SIVA, the Golden  Age wonder discovered in the Cosmodrome. As the  Splicersï¿½ knowledge of SIVAï¿½s potential began to take  shape, a rift grew between their techno-religious  leaders and a younger, more ambitious sect of their  rank-and-file ï¿½ Devil Splicers. The leaders saw in SIVA a  new god to worship. The Devil Splicers saw a way to  become one with the very technology they worshiped.  SIVA was a means to a greater end: evolution.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    BOOK  I  FUNDAMENT    2       3  Verse 1.0 - Fundament  Dearest sisters,  Itï¿½s taken me two years ï¿½ a quarter of our lives ï¿½  but Iï¿½ve found the proof. We arenï¿½t native to the  Fundament. Our ancient ancestors came here to  hide.  The plate of stone we live on, our Osmium Court, is  one fragment of a rocky planet that crashed into the  Fundament and broke apart. All the other nearby  continents ï¿½ the Helium Drinkers, the Bone Plaza,  the Starcutters ï¿½ came from the same world.  Perhaps the other races of the Fundament are  migrants too.  We live on the shrapnel of our homeworld, floating  on an ocean deep inside a gas giant.  Thatï¿½s what Fundament must be. A titanic gas  planet. The endless storm above us must be one  layer of the atmosphere. And the sea we float on...  thereï¿½s more down beneath it. So much more!  You understand what this means, Sathona. The  Timid Truth is a lie. We arenï¿½t meant to be the  worldï¿½s prey. We werenï¿½t born to live and die in the  dark.  We have a better destiny.   Calcified Fragment: Curiosity    4  The Helium Drinker ambassador ate ten of  my sisters as tribute. This is normal.  However, I resent it.  MOTHERS. Mothers can fly! They live much  longer than ten years. Mothers are extremely  smart, and they guard their spawn. If you try  to tamper with the eggs, they will eat you.  Sathona wants to eat the jelly and become a  mother when she turns four.  STORMS. The rain is often poisonous.  Sometimes it dissolves flesh. When lightning  misses the lightning farm, it can vaporize a  person.  This entire world is deadly to us.  MYSTERIES. The Fundament is very large.  We are the smallest things in it. If you donï¿½t  understand something, it will probably kill  you. My teacher Taox says this is why we  have such short lives. So we can breed and  adapt quickly.  MOON WAVES. My sister Aurash is afraid  of moon waves. When she gets back from  her expedition to the Tungsten Monoliths, I  will ask her why.   I: Predators  Verse 1:1 ï¿½ Predators  Predators and Menaces ï¿½  Carved to endure by Xi Ro ï¿½  Third surviving sister of the Osmium Kingï¿½s last  brood ï¿½  A STORMJOY. A stormjoy is a living cloud. When  it passes over our continent, it lowers its feeding  tentacles. On each tentacle are the BAIT STARS.  Although light makes you happy, you must avoid  it. You will be eaten.  A stormjoy is a good way for an old person to  choose death. Also, a daring knight can cut the  bait stars from the tentacles. I have six!  FALLING. If you fall off the edge of the continent,  you will die in the ocean! This is a special hazard  when our father the Osmium King uses the  engines.  HELIUM DRINKERS. The currents of the  Fundament Ocean bring us near other continents.  The Helium Court is near us now. They are of our  species, but they are our enemies. Their knights  raid us every day. Helium Drinkers have two legs,  two arms, and three eyes, just like us. But they are  bright/evil. I want to be a knight and fight them!    5  Verse 1:2 ï¿½ The Hateful Verse  For the consideration of the Helium Court,  Written in desperation,  This sealed secret,  I am Taox, sterile mother, teacher to the children  of the Osmium Throne.  As a mother, I live long. As a neuter, I can rise  above the small battles of court politics.  I alone see the patterns of survival. Alone I  designed the great engines that move the Osmium  Court. Now ï¿½  Alone I must act to save my kingdom.  Senility has claimed my lord the Osmium King.  He is ten, and mad. The study of ancient text  consumes him. Today he raves about moons  above the storm. Tomorrow he will wander the  halls, speaking to his familiar, a dead white worm  from the deep sea. He keeps it in glass, and he  tends to it, and he neglects the duties of a king.  The Osmium King has three surviving heirs, each  two years old:  Xi Ro, the youngest and bravest, who wants to be  a knight.  Sathona, most clever, who wants to be a  mother.  Aurash, navigator child, who dreams of the  infinite ocean. Tomorrow she will return from  the Tungsten Monoliths.  None of these are suitable heirs. None of them  will protect the Osmium Court from the  howling Fundament. Xi Ro can fight, but not  lead. Sathona can think, but not fight. Aurashï¿½s  curiosity will draw her away from duty. I fear  for all future children.  Soon the Osmium King will lock himself into  the Royal Orrery to study the moons. Gather  your knights, o Helium Drinkers, and invade  our continent. Kill the three heirs. I will rule the  Osmium Court as your regent, and build  engines for you.  And if I fail, let the Leviathan in the deep eat  me.  Written in grief,  This hateful request,  Taox, Osmium-mother, neutered to watch   II: The Hateful Verse    6  Verse 1:3 ï¿½ The Oath  Sisters! This is how an oath is done. Put your left  hands on the mast, close to mine.  Take the knife in your right hand. Push it through  your left hand, straight between the bones.  Now! Carve a blood line down the mast.  Speak your oath.  ï¿½I am Xi Ro, youngest daughter of the dead  king. I will take back my Osmium Court and kill  the traitor Taox. On my left eye I swear  vengeance.ï¿½  In blood the oath is made.  ï¿½I am Sathona, middle daughter of the dead  king. I will take back my home and eat the  mother jelly. I will raise my spawn on the corpse  of the Helium King. On my right eye I promise  this.ï¿½  In blood the oath is made.  Now...  ï¿½I will help make your oath, sister.ï¿½  ï¿½I will help it too.ï¿½  I am Aurash, first daughter of the dead king. I  will chase my fatherï¿½s last screamed warning. I  will know what changed the motion of our  moons. If the end of the world is coming, I will  understand why.  On my center eye I swear it. I will understand.  ï¿½In blood the oath is made.ï¿½  ï¿½In blood.ï¿½  Thank you, sisters. We have only my ship left  to us. But a ship is freedom! We have secrets  to hunt, storm-lit realms to explore, and great  armies to raise.  Put up the lightning sails, and we will voyage  far.   III: The Oath    7  Verse 1:4 ï¿½ Syzygy  The Syzygy ï¿½  Carved to endure by Aurash ï¿½  The high vengeance ï¿½  Only Xi Roï¿½s bait stars let us escape. Only  Sathonaï¿½s tricks let us reach the coast. But now  that we have my ship, I must lead the way. I am  the navigator.  We may never see our homes again. Xi Ro  seethes with hate and fury for Taox.  But this is my deepest fear ï¿½  Our civilization drifts on the Fundament. At the  Tungsten Monoliths I learned that thousands of  other species drift with us, coexisting on a vast  world sea. And the tides of the Fundament move  us all.  The Timid Truth says that we are the smallest,  most fragile things alive. The natural prey of the  universe. Taox would have us believe that our  ancestors came to the Fundament to hide from the  hungry void.  My father died afraid. Not of vile Taox or the  Helium Drinkers, but of his orrery. He screamed to  me ï¿½  ï¿½Aurash, my first daughter! The moons are  different! The laws are bent!ï¿½  And he made the sign of a syzygy.  Imagine the fifty-two moons of Fundament  lining up in the sky. (It wouldnï¿½t take all fiftytwo,  of course: just a few massive moons. But  this is my deepest fear.) Imagine their gravity  pulling on the Fundament sea, lifting it into a  swollen bulge...  Imagine that bulge collapsing as the syzygy  passed. A wave big enough to swallow  civilizations. A God-Wave.  I have to find a way to stop it. Before the God-  Wave annihilates my species. If I could only  get back into my fatherï¿½s orrery, I could learn  exactly when!  We are weeks of travel and many continents  away from home.  When Iï¿½m paralyzed by fear, Xi Ro sits in the  cabin with me and comforts me with soft,  brave words. But more and more we have  come to rely on Sathonaï¿½s wit. She will go off  to be alone (she insists she must be alone) and  return with some mad idea ï¿½ steer into the  storm, throw down a net, eat that strange  beast, explore that menacing wreck.  Somehow Sathona seems to manufacture good  luck by sheer will.   IV: Syzygy    10  This is not a sea-ship, like Aurashï¿½s. It is an  artifact of high technology.  3. I know its purpose. I know what  happened to the crew.  4. Xi Ro wants to sell the ship at Kaharn  Atoll, where species gather. At auction, it  would earn us enough wealth to hire  mercenaries. We could retake our Osmium  Court and send the baby-eating Helium  Drinkers screaming into the ocean ï¿½  5. ï¿½ but I told Xi Ro the ship was worthless.  6. Aurash wants to open the ship and see if  we can take command of it. I know this is the  right thing to do. I know because I asked the  worm...  The worm ï¿½  Carved in my code by Sathona ï¿½  Who should be afraid ï¿½  1. It was my fatherï¿½s familiar. I ripped it from  him as we fled. It is a dead white thing,  segmented, washed up from the deep sea.  2. Itï¿½s dead, but it still speaks to me. It says:  listen closely, oh vengeance mine...   V: Needle and Worm  Verse 1:5 ï¿½ Needle and Worm  My secrets ï¿½  Carved in my code by Sathona ï¿½  The right eye vengeance ï¿½  1. This year of wild voyaging, these lightning  nights and golden days, these forays into ancient  wrecks and windblown flights from monsters:  these are the happiest times of my life.  2. I want to be a mother not because I want to  spawn but because I want a long life. Long  enough to make a difference. We have been at  sea a year and I am afraid, afraid we will die out  here.  3. I know where to find secrets. I know where  vast slow things with long memories live.  4. The needle ship...  The needle ship ï¿½  Carved in my code by Sathona ï¿½  A liar ï¿½  1. We salvaged the needle from the Shvubi  Maelstrom. I knew it would be there.  2. The needle is a gray ship, as long and slender  as hope, as unbreakable as time, and old. Older  than death. It tumbled through the maelstrom  before our ancestors crashed into the Fundament.    11  Verse 1:6 ï¿½ Sisters  A register of tokens and gestures exchanged  before the end of sisterhood.  ï¿½Xi Ro, my brave sister, you have worked too  hard to move the carcasses out of the birthing  room! Come. Steer the ship for a while. Take joy  in what our needle can do.ï¿½  Xi Ro tried to protest, but secretly, she was so  glad for Aurashï¿½s care. She flew the needle ship  in cutting circles, down beneath the sea: and  their wake rose up to the surface like a traitorï¿½s  dying breath.  ï¿½Aurash, lonely navigator, we have traveled so  long with only each other. I know you love to  hear and speak new tongues. Come, sit in the  flesh garden room. I will read you these stories I  bought at Kaharn.ï¿½  Aurash sat among the mummified flesh fans with  two of her eyes closed and listened in silence to  Sathonaï¿½s stories, hungry to understand,  voracious to know as much as she could before  her ten year life died.  Later, Xi Ro said, ï¿½Sathona, cutting mind of ours,  you grow lonely in your thought. Play swords  and lanterns with me!ï¿½  But Sathona was heavy with sorrow, and  couldnï¿½t pretend any joy as she chased Xi Ro  through the needleï¿½s glistening halls.  ï¿½Sathona, pensive one, what is it? What  troubles you?ï¿½     12  Her sisters listened as Sathona said ï¿½Oathbearing  siblings, we are five years old. For two  years weï¿½ve worked to repair this ancient ship  and understand its systems. I am almost too old  for the mother jelly, and the knights who killed  our father are surely dying of age.  ï¿½We three will die here, in exile. Taox will  outlive us. And Aurash, brilliant-eyed Aurash,  you will die of old age long before you have  proof of your God-Wave, or any way to stop it.ï¿½  Aurash and Xi Ro looked at each other. ï¿½I wish  you werenï¿½t so honest,ï¿½ Xi Ro said. And Aurash  thought that Sathona had never been wrong.  In her soul Aurash knew that the only way to  keep their oath was to find a great, powerful  secret. A secret that could change everything.  This was Aurashï¿½s soul, her fire and her shadow  ï¿½ her desire to cut through the flank of the  world and find its beating heart.  ï¿½We have to dive,ï¿½ Aurash said. ï¿½Thatï¿½s what  this ship is built to do. Dive into the Fundament,  the world below us... towards the core.ï¿½  ï¿½Thatï¿½s where the ancient crew died so  obscenely,ï¿½ Xi Ro protested. ï¿½Thatï¿½s where the  atrocity in the birthing room was born...ï¿½  ï¿½We have to dive,ï¿½ Sathona said, following the  whispers of her familiar. ï¿½In the world beneath  us, in the metallic depths, I hope we may find  what we need most...ï¿½  More time. More life.   VI: Sisters    13  Verse 1:7 ï¿½ The Dive  For life, Sathona dove. For vengeance, Xi Ro  dove. And Aurash dove to understand.  The needle ship pierced the skin of the world and  burrowed deep. Through layers of foam and  metal and cold elemental slush. Aurash devoured  the shipï¿½s maps of Fundament, from the high  angelic cloud decks, down and down through  storms and oceans and plates of floating world,  into the crush of the core.  They met monsters of continental scope. Vast  anemones that raised glowing tentacles to bait  them in. Xi Ro flew the needle ship through them  and they bled black carbon jelly and frost.  They came to a still place, beneath a plate of  metal.  ï¿½Iï¿½ll use the sensors,ï¿½ whispered Aurash.  ï¿½Listen...ï¿½  In the wet gold dark of the helm, they listened to  the ship, and the ship listened to the crushing  motions of Fundament.  They heard the collision of continents. They heard  the patter and the crash of helium-neon rain. They  heard the struggles of monsters. And they heard  the distant groan of the ocean rising. Tugged  by distant moons.  ï¿½The syzygy is real...ï¿½ Sathona hissed. ï¿½Itï¿½s  already begun.ï¿½  Behind them, Xi Ro thought of the birthingroom,  where ancient explorers had labored  over surgeries and administrations, peeling  back the chrysalis and the caul of that which  they had made from the deep, whose birth  none of them would survive...  ï¿½Thereï¿½s something down here,ï¿½ she whispered.  ï¿½Something secret.ï¿½  And the Leviathan loomed over them, its brow  as huge all the continents of their childhood, its  great array-fins crackling with the lightning of  its life. Booming into the hull of the needle ship  in a microwave voice:  ++YOU MUST TURN BACKï¿½  ï¿½SAVE YOURSELVES FROM THE DEEP++  ++SAVE THE WORLD FROM YOURSELVESï¿½  ï¿½YOU MUST TURN BACK++   VII: The DIve    15  Verse 1:8 ï¿½ Leviathan  The Leviathanï¿½s Warning  ++We live on the edge of a warï¿½  ï¿½a war between Formless and Form++  ++between the Deep and the Skyï¿½  ++MY EYES ARE WIDE, MY GAZE IS LONG+  + ï¿½Across the universe, as far as I see++  ++the Sky works to charge its firesï¿½  ï¿½and the Deep drowns the ash++  ï¿½Sky builds gentle places, safe for life++  ++Beloved Fundament, refuge of trillionsï¿½  ï¿½The Sky treasures this rich place++  ï¿½BUT THE DEEP IS HERE WITH USï¿½  ++Cold logic tests our wallsï¿½  ï¿½The Deep claims its dominion++  ++A ruthless, final age ï¿½  Aurashï¿½s Protest  Old Leviathan, creature of myth, this world is no  refuge. We live short, hard lives. We die in the  dark. The storm above us will never end. And  soon the God-Wave will take us all. Above us  there are only stormjoys, monsters, and moons of  apocalypse. Let us go down, down, where we  may discover truth, some power to avenge  ourselves upon our betrayers, some hope of  survival.  The Leviathanï¿½s Hope  ï¿½What power calls you++  ++Down to the deep?ï¿½  ++What instinct draws youï¿½  ï¿½Away from high hope?++  ï¿½Quick-breeding krill people, I tell you++  ++For eons I have watched your struggleï¿½  ï¿½Clinging to the sharp edge of survival++  ++Balanced between the Deep and the Sky.ï¿½  ++You were my treasureï¿½  ï¿½My proof against despair++    16  ï¿½The Deep embraces deathï¿½  ++Saying: this is inevitable and right++  ï¿½I exist as hungry ruinï¿½  ++TURN BACK FROM THE WORLD-KILLING  WAY++  ++OR YOU WILL LIVE AS DEATH AND  DEVASTATION++  ï¿½The Sky is the harder way. But it is kinder.ï¿½  ï¿½My charge is balanced: my voice  exhausted.ï¿½  Sathonaï¿½s Protest  Sisters, I have my fatherï¿½s familiar. Look! It  answers me in plain words. It helped me find  this ship. It gives me strength when hope is  lost.  Who will you trust? The voice that wants us to  live and suffer, as we have lived and suffered?  The Leviathan that offers no hope against Taox  or the world-wave?  Or the plain, honest worm?  Let us see where its whisper leads us, Aurash.  Let us go deeper, Xi Ro!  Let us dive, oh sisters mine.   VIII: Leviathan  ï¿½FOR THIS IS THE DEEP CLAIMï¿½  ++Existence is the struggle to existï¿½  ï¿½When the struggle seems lost++  ++when the safe place crumblesï¿½  ï¿½everything turns to the Deep to survive++  ++I REJECT THE DEEP CLAIM++  ï¿½You will turn back, sweet krill of hope.ï¿½ï¿½  ++You will choose the Sky instead.ï¿½  Xi Roï¿½s Protest  You are huge and old! Our lives are short and  desperate. If thatï¿½s the way the worldï¿½s supposed  to be, I wonï¿½t have it! If people like Taox are  supposed to win, I wonï¿½t let them! Iï¿½ll beat the  world until it changes! Iï¿½ll kill anything in the way!

We offer to  each of you a bargain... a symbiosis.  Take into your bodies our children, our  newborn larvae. From them you shall obtain  eternal life. From them you shall gain power  over your own fragile flesh: the power to  make of it as you will. And should you find an  imperfection in the world, an injustice or an  inconvenience ï¿½ you will have the power to  repair it. Let no mere law bind you.  We ask one thing in exchange, oh Princes.  You must obey your nature forever. In your  immortality, Aurash, you may never cease to  explore and inquire, for the sake of your  children. In your immortality, Xi Ro, you may  never cease to test your strength. In your  immortality, Sathona, you may never  abandon cunning.  If you do, your worm will consume you. And  as your power grows, oh Princes, so will your  wormï¿½s appetite.  But we offer eternity, Aurash. We offer you a  chance at the universe. Would you deny your  people infinity?  Reach up to me. Let my flesh be your  sacrament.   IX: The Bargain  Verse 1:9 ï¿½ The Bargain  You are Aurash. Heir to the Osmium Throne.  You stand on the naked hull of an ancient ship.  You stand exposed to the crushing pressure and  ferocious heat of the deeper Fundament. It should  annihilate you. It is by my will alone that you  survive.  I am Yul, the Honest Worm.  Behold my passage. Behold my vast  displacement, my ponderous strength, my great  and coiling length, my folded jaws and curled  wings. Behold the hiving cities symbiotic with my  flesh. I am fecund, Aurash. I am at the beginning  and end of lives.  Behold Eir, and Xol, and Ur, and Akka. The  Virtuous Worms. Look upon us, and know that We  are go[o]d.  For millions of years We have been [trapped|  growing] in the Deep. From across the stars We  have called life to Fundament, so that it might  contend against extinction. For millennia We have  awaited you... our beloved hosts.  Against you stand the cruel Leviathan and all the  forces of the Sky. They would crush you down into  the dark. They have arranged their moons to  drown you, in fear of your potential.    Verse  2:0  ï¿½  Immortals    WearetheWormyourGod,theFleshofHope.

You love to  conquer, donï¿½t you? We love to see you work.  Nearly two percent of Fundamentï¿½s surface is now  our dominion. Your species embraces the worm.  The syzygy has passed. The God-Wave will reach  you in less than two years.  Our organs informs us that Taox and her surviving  Refusalists flee towards Kaharn Atoll. She hopes  to rally the species of Fundament against you. The  Leviathanï¿½s agents work tirelessly to destroy ships  and engines, trapping us on Fundament.  If we cannot make ships, we will become them.  Overwhelm the Kaharn bastion. Slaughter  everyone there. From your acts we shall obtain  the logic we require to cut space open and  migrate to orbit.  Reality is a fine flesh, oh general ours. Let us feast  of it.

Behold:  we  are  faithful  to  our  covenant.    We  have  no  future  on  Fundament.  But  her  moons  will  make  fine  habitats.  Let  us  rise.     XIII:IntotheSky 22       23  Verse 2:4 ï¿½ 52 and One  Good news. The fifty-two moons of Fundament  host a starfaring civilization far more  sophisticated than anything youï¿½ve encountered  so far. Taoxï¿½s ship fled towards the large ice  moon, where a species of bony six-armed  cephalopods keeps their icy capital. Savathï¿½nï¿½s  named them the Ammonite. They seem eager to  grant Taox asylum. Idiots.  We tried appealing to their hopes and dreams.  This was largely unsuccessful, basically because  theyï¿½re already happy and indoctrinated. This  angered us, so weï¿½ve devised a plan.  Our organs detect a fifty-third moon in orbit of  Fundament. A Traveler. Divine presence of the  Sky. Now we know what arranged the syzygy.  Youï¿½ll have to kill them all and take their stuff.  Once the Ammonite are out of the way, we can  deal with the Traveler.  Do not hesitate. Youï¿½re fighting the hypocritical  puppets of a cosmic parasite. Avenge your  ancestors.   XIV: 52 and One     24  fair cosmos. These are the bait stars the Sky uses  to blind its slaves.  War is the natural rectification of inequality. The  universeï¿½s way of pursuing equilibrium.  Xivu Arath, you cannot defeat the Ammonites and  Taox in line combat. We propose new tactics.  Breed your armies back to strength, and find a  way to disperse the broods across these many  moons.  If we cannot defeat their strengths, we will infect  their weaknesses.   XV: Born as Prey  Verse 2:5 ï¿½ Born As Prey  This is unacceptable.  Are you so weak? Born as prey, and doomed  to die by predator?  Auryxï¿½s failure of resolve led us to catastrophe.  The Ammonite fleets under Chroma-Admiral  Rafriit have pressed us back to the sixth moon.  Once more we find ourselves burrowing into a  worldï¿½s core to survive.  Savathï¿½n. You must draw Auryx out of his  catatonia. Make him understand that the ideals  of peace and stability he clings to are cancers  ï¿½ brutal, unjust obstacles between us and a    25  Verse 2:6 ï¿½ The Sword Logic  AT LAST!  We knew curiosity would draw you back, Auryx.  In their desperation, the Ammonite have begun  using paracausal weapons.  What are these? How do they work? Wouldnï¿½t  you like to know. Suffice to say that some powers  in this universe are superordinate to mere  material physics.  The source of these weapons is the Traveler, the  Skyï¿½s bait star. Their effect is subtle, but  devastating.  But you are armed to respond in kind. Savathï¿½nï¿½s  mothers have listened carefully to our teachings.  We will not give you the Deep, King Auryx ï¿½  that power is for us, your gods. But we will teach  you to call upon that force with signs and rituals.  Small minds might call it magic.  You are no longer bound by causal closure. Your  will defeats law. Kill a hundred of your children  with a long blade, Auryx, and observe the  change in the blade. Observe how the universe  shrinks from you in terror.  Your existence begins to define itself.  Of course, high Auryx, we know it was not  curiosity alone that brought you back to the war.  You felt your own death growing inside you.  You must obey your nature. Your worm must  feed...   XVI: The Sword Logic  Verse 2:7 ï¿½ The Weakness Verse  You are dead, young Auryx. Betrayed and  murdered by your own sister, for the crime of  mercy.  Remember what you said to the Ammonite  Satellite Congress? ï¿½We will parley on neutral  ground?ï¿½ Savathï¿½nï¿½s witches have rendered it  utterly neutral. No living thing will ever claim it  again. The space around the dry moon stinks  of rot.  This is good. This is right. You will learn from  this. Donï¿½t you understand, great King? Donï¿½t  you want to build something real, something  that lasts forever?  Our universe gutters down towards cold  entropy. Life is an engine that burns up energy  and produces decay. Life builds selfish, stupid  rules ï¿½ morality is one of them, and the  sanctity of life is another.  These rules are impediments to the great work.  The work of building a perfect, undying  creation, a civilization everlasting. Something  that cannot end.  If a civilization cannot defend itself, it must be  annihilated. If a King cannot hold his power,    26  Verse 2:8 ï¿½ Leviathan Rises  The Leviathan has broken cover.  The old priest is in open space, moving towards  the Ammonite home moon. Chroma-Admiral  Rafriit and his elite guard move with it. Rafriit is  the hero of his generation, an Ammonite of  peerless battlecraft. Heï¿½s danced circles around  Xivu Arath... but now he has to protect his holy  Leviathan.  Weï¿½ll give the old lunk a word:  ++Ruin. Grief and ruin!ï¿½  ï¿½The krill lost. The Ammonite ravaged.++  ++Our Travelerï¿½s work undone.ï¿½  ï¿½Sisters of Aurash, open your eyes++  ++Who made you monsters? Who summoned  the wave?ï¿½  ï¿½Make peace. Join with me in golden renewal.  ++  In counterargument, Auryx, we ask you this:  what has the Leviathan done for your people?  Who gave you immortality and led you out of  your prison? Who answers your questions  about the universe with truth, instead of  sermons?  Find dï¿½tente with Savathï¿½n. Crush the Chroma-  Admiral, boil the Ammonite seas, and slaughter  the Leviathan with witchcraft.  Once the way is open, weï¿½ll show you how to  eat the Traveler.   XVIII: Leviathan Rises  he must be betrayed. The worth of a thing can  be determined only by one beautiful arbiter ï¿½  that thingï¿½s ability to exist, to go on existing, to  remake existence to suit its survival.  All that would oppose this arbiter is unholy and  false. All the misery and terror of your ancestors  springs from the lies of the Sky, who deny this  truth.  Your ancestors endured the most hostile  conditions. And now you must go on creating  those conditions. Even unto your sisters. Even  unto your offspring. Savathï¿½nï¿½s betrayal is the  greatest gift she could offer you.  Your body is gone, but you have endured. Safe  in the cyst universe created by your own might  ï¿½ your throne world.  From this day forward, Auryx, you and your  sisters will each survive death ï¿½ so long as you  arenï¿½t killed in your own throne.  Even as your sisters press the attack against the  Ammonites, the God-Wave devastates  Fundament. Trillions will die. But the survivors  will never forget... and their descendants will  always be ready for another syzygy.  When you return to the material universe, use  this lesson to complete your work.  Taox wasnï¿½t on the dry moon. She must be  laughing at you.   XVII: The Weakness Verse    27  Verse 2:9 ï¿½ Crusaders  Itï¿½s done. Eir and Yul feed on the Leviathanï¿½s  carcass. Xivu Arath has made a temple of the  Chroma-Admiralï¿½s impaled corpse. Below us,  Savathï¿½nï¿½s poisons stain the Ammonite home sea  black. Their screams flavor the void.  The Traveler has fled.  Do you understand, Auryx? Do you thrill at the  secret, Savathï¿½n? Do you relish the edge of this  truth, Xivu Arath? Do you see the beautiful shape?  The Ammonite occupied a piece of reality. They  rented their existence on fraudulent terms, making  themselves happy and fat, fencing themselves in  soft lies and sweet apocrypha. Saying: ï¿½we are  peaceful and good, we harm nothing.ï¿½  Their golden age was a cancer.  They did nothing to advance the cause of life!  They burnt up time and matter and thought on this  solipsistic, onanistic pursuit of safety, insulating  themselves from death, making a regressive  pocket of useless stability. When they could have  helped whittle the universe towards its final,  perfect form!  And your people, suffering in the Deep, you  became more worthy of existence than the  Ammonite. You have proven it.  Look around the sky. Behold the great divide,  the battle lines of the cosmic war. We are the  Worm your God, but we are not the Deep  Itself. We only move within it. You shall too.  You shall venerate and study it and haunt it  in its passage.  Will you lift your thoughts to the millennia,  Auryx? Will you bend your will to the  liberation of the universe, and join us in the  war against the Sky?  We need champions. Crusaders. Help us  save the universe. Help us exterminate that  which would destroy all hope. You are  oathbound to this task, by the covenant of  the worm.  And you are oathbound to kill Taox.  Wherever sheï¿½s hidden herself.   XIX: Crusaders    BOOK  II  SWORD  LOGIC    30       31  Verse 3:0 ï¿½ Hive  Let us speak of the terrible beauty of becoming  ourselves.  In the beginning we rode hollow moons from star  to star. AURYX said, become as numerous and  fertile as seeds in rich flesh, and thus we did  become numerous. XIVU ARATH said, become as  hungry and defiant as tumors in rich flesh, and  thus we became cancerous. SAVATHï¿½N said,  drink of the poisons of the worm, so that you  might feed on death, and we did feed. This was  preparation for our crusade.  Aia! We were thus becoming.  A mother Wizard gets fertility from a mate, or  from herself. From the Wizard the spawn, from  the spawn our Thrall, from the survivors our  Acolytes who contend. If they contend well, their  worm is fed, and from the well fed worm come  Knights and Wizards and Princes.  This is us, and our purpose is liberation, our great  task is the worship and admiration of freedom,  our great hunger is to pursue and eat that which  is not free, and to liberate it with devouring. Aiat.  This is us, we the Hive.   XX: Hive  Verse 3:1 ï¿½ an incision  Sayeth AURYX, my siblings, our children are  scattered across many moons, and we live in the  cold dark between suns. What will we eat?  How will we speak?  SAVATHï¿½N said, Auryx my brother and king, I  have studied the wounds cut by the Worm our  God. Also I have studied the manner of your  death and return. These two things are the  same, for they are predicated on death and the  passage through cut spaces. Let us practice the  sword logic until we are sharp. We may then  cut our own wounds and step through.  But XIVU ARATH said, sister, I am already  sharp, look, my sword cuts into another space.  And she cut her way between moons through  green fire and joyous screams.  Three kingdoms grew swollen in the sword  space. They were the gaze and glory of  AURYX, the cunning and knowledge of  SAVATHï¿½N, the triumph and brawn of XIVU  ARATH. These kingdoms were created from the  minds and worms of our lords. They were  coterminous with all spaces consecrated by our  Hive. Through these spaces passed speech and  food, and all the moons were bound close.  Sayeth AURYX, this is where I went when I  died. Let us establish our thrones here. For I am  Auryx the First Navigator and I shall chart  death. And my throne shall be carved of  osmium.

AURYX  said, I shall establish a court, and whoever  comes into this court may challenge me. My  court will be the High War. It will be a killing  ground and a school of the sword logic we have  learned from our gods.  SAVATHï¿½N thought this was a great idea. She  made a court called the High Coven. XIVU  ARATH said, the world is my court, wherever  there is war.   XXII: The High War  Verse 3:2 ï¿½ The High War  Now in this time of diaspora there was a war  between AURYX and SAVATHï¿½N and XIVU  ARATH.  Brother Auryx, said SAVATHï¿½N, do not forgive  my betrayal. Instead, take vengeance upon me  for what I did at the dry moon! And AURYX  made war on her, in worship of the Deep.  Between them stood XIVU ARATH saying, stop,  or I will kill you, war is mine and I am  strongest.  This was how they worshipped.  For twenty thousand years they fought across  the moons and they fought in the abyssal plains  and lightning palaces of each other's sword  spaces. And they killed each other again and    33  Verse 3:3 ï¿½ fire without fuel  I killed my sister today.  She came to this star to oversee the extermination  of all life here. The Qugu are a strong power, and  their fleets protect four nearby stars. As herd  animals they are loyal and stubborn. But they do  show grace.  For millions of years of evolution the Qugu have  been infected by a virus so insidious that it wrote  itself into their genome. The virus compels them to  offer their limbs for amputation by enormous  sessile jaw-beasts. They venerate these beasts and  treat them as gods. The virus converts Qugu cells  into eggs, from which strange crawling things  pupate, to live within the jaw-beast gut. In turn the  jaw-beast extrudes sweet nectar for the Qugu to  drink, and they have brilliant visions.  Savathï¿½n and her broods have liberated the  Qugu from jaw-beasts, and indeed from  existence. But as they chased the Qugu ark-ships,  I stopped in to vaporize my sisterï¿½s warship and a  few of her underlings. I want to dwell on the ruins  a while, and punish Savathï¿½n for failing to guard  her flank.  They are like us, these Qugu. Bound in symbiosis.  I feel joy, and sorrow. I feel them as titanic things,  because I am larger than my body, my mind is  now a cosmos of its own. I know more joy and  more anguish than the entire Qugu race could  ever experience.  Sorrow, because we have killed so much  (eighteen species this century alone), and joy  for the same reason. Joy that we have put  down these blights. Scoured them away and  left the universe clean, ready to move towards  its final shape. We are a wind of progress.  Ripping parasites from the material world ï¿½  for if they were not parasites, we would be  unable to kill them, and they would still exist.  And what is that final shape? It is a fire without  fuel, burning forever, killing death, asking a  question that is its own answer, entirely itself.  That is what we must become.  My worm grows fat and hungry. I feed it with  whole worlds. My astronomers tell me they can  sense the Deep Itself, and that we are  conquering our way towards it.  I think joy and sorrow will be the same thing  soon. Like love and death.   XXIII: Fire Without Fuel    Verse  3:4  ï¿½  THE  SCREAM    grow.  Faster  and  faster.    NO Savathï¿½n!  Xivu  Arath!

They are huge, huge, and they  burn with furious power. But this embrace is  weakness and we despise it.  Never before have we despised our lords. Have  they failed us? We the Hive have been driven  back, world by world.  ï¿½I am at my end,ï¿½ Savathï¿½n says. ï¿½I plot and  plan. But I cannot gather enough bloodshed to  feed my worm.

I too  am at my end.ï¿½  ï¿½The Ecumene war angels have killed me so  many times,ï¿½ Auryx says, ï¿½that I dare not go out  into the universe, lest I need my might to protect  myself. My worm chews at my soul in hunger.ï¿½  Is this the end of our crusade? Are we the Hive  unworthy to exist?  Xivu Arath puts down her great head. ï¿½We  should retire and gather our strength.ï¿½  Savathï¿½n closes her eyes in puzzled defeat.    41  ï¿½We should beg the Worm our God to tell us  what to do.ï¿½  But King Auryx, who knows best the beauty of  the final shape, roars at them. ï¿½Have you  learned nothing? Would you deny our purpose?  Whatever we do, we will do by killing, by an  act of war and might. That is the final arbiter  we serve, that violent arbiter, and if we turn  away from it we deserve to be eaten. No! We  must obey our natures. We must be longsighted,  and cunning, and strong. We must  take this gift the Worm our God has given us,  this challenge, and find a way to keep  existing!ï¿½  ï¿½How will we feed our worms?ï¿½ Xivu Arath  asks.  ï¿½I know,ï¿½ says cunning Savathï¿½n. ï¿½I know a  way. But it wonï¿½t work unless we are killing the  Ecumene by the billions. How can we beat them?ï¿½  ï¿½If we cannot beat their strengths,ï¿½ says Xivu  Arath, ï¿½we must infect their weaknesses.

In the cold abyss of the sword world, King  Aurash walked under a cloak of green fire.  He walked through the sky and the sky  shuddered and froze beneath his feet. He  walked until he found Akka, the Worm of  Secrets, who was denying a truth until it  became a lie.  ï¿½Akka my God, Worm of Secrets. I am  But King Auryx turned with the speed and might of  Xivu Arath, and beheaded Savathï¿½n before she  could move. King Auryx was the First Navigator,  with the map of death.  These were true deaths, for they happened in the  sword world.  Then he went to the Worm named Akka.   XXVI: star by star by star    43  of Ruin. And he wore them about his waist.  Then Auryx said, ï¿½Now I may speak to the Deep,  the beautiful final shape. I will be King of Shapes.  I will learn all the secrets of our destiny.ï¿½  His speech to the Deep is not recorded here. But  it is known that he returned, and he said, now I  am Oryx, the Taken King. And I have the power  to take life and make it my own.  Then he went out into the universe, and fought the  Ecumene with his Tablets. And the Worm his God  was pleased.   XXVIII: King of Shapes  Verse 3:9 ï¿½ Carved in Ruin  Oryx made war on the Ecumene for a hundred  years. At the end of those hundred years he killed  the Ecumene Council on the Fractal Wreath, and  from their blood rose Xivu Arath, saying, ï¿½I am  war, and you have conjured me back with war.ï¿½  Oryx was glad, for he loved Xivu Arath. The  Ecumene wailed in grief.  Then Oryx and Xivu Arath made war on the  Ecumene for forty years. At the end of those forty  years Oryx said to the Dakaua Nest, listen, I am  jealous of my sibling Xivu Arath, help me kill her.  And in desperation they agreed.  Auryx, sole king of the Hive. I have come to  receive a secret. I want the secret power of  the Deep, which you hold.ï¿½  ï¿½I give no secrets,ï¿½ said Akka, whose voice  was code.  ï¿½No,ï¿½ said Auryx, ï¿½you give nothing. Giving  is for the Sky. You worship the Deep, which  asks that we take what we need.ï¿½  Akka said nothing, because if it denied this  truth, the truth might become false.  ï¿½But you gave us your larvae, the worm,ï¿½ said  Auryx, ï¿½and that is why the worm devours us  now: because it was given, not taken. So I  must take what I need from you, although you  are my god.ï¿½  Said Akka, ï¿½You have not the strength.ï¿½  But this was a lie. Auryx had killed Savathï¿½n  his sibling and Xivu Arath his sibling, and he  had the sword logic of killing them.  Auryx the First Navigator set upon his god  with his sword and his words, and cut Akka to  pieces, and took from those pieces the secret  of calling upon the Deep. He wrote this secret  on a set of tablets, which he called the Tablets    44  you pay tribute.  You Knights and Wizards, lead your followers in  battle. Take enough devastation to feed your  worm, and a little more to grow, and take the  tithe of your followers. Then take another portion,  as much as you dare, and use it for your own  purposes. But if it is too much, your peers will kill  you and take it. Then tithe the remainder to the  Ascendant you serve.  An Ascendant will be those among the Hive who  gather enough tribute to enter the netherworld.  They will pay a tithe to those above them.  And thus the tribute will flow, up the chain, so  that Savathï¿½n and Xivu Arath and myself will be  fed by a great river of tribute, and we will use  that excess to feed our gods, and to study the  Deep. Thus all worms will be fed ï¿½ as long as  we continue our crusade.  This is my law. I carve it thus, in ruin. Aiat.   XXIX: Carved in Ruin  But he drove the Dakaua Nest into a trap, and  they were made extinct. From their ashes rose  cunning Savathï¿½n, saying, ï¿½I am trickery, and  you have conjured me back with trickery.ï¿½  Oryx was glad, for he loved Savathï¿½n. The  Ecumene fled into the void.  Then they made war on the Ecumene for a  thousand years, and exterminated them so  wholly that nowhere except in this book are  they remembered. This book and the mind of  Taox, who was not found.  And Savathï¿½n said, ï¿½King Oryx, how will we  feed our worms? Did you use my plan?ï¿½  Oryx told the Hive: I am the Taken King, and  here is my law.  You Thrall, each of you will claw and scream,  and kill what you can. Take enough killing to  feed your worm, and a little more to grow.  Tithe the rest to the Acolyte who commands  you.  You Acolytes, lead your Thrall in battle. Take  enough killing to feed your worm, and a little  more to grow, and take the tithe of the Thrall  you lead. Then tithe the remainder to the  Knight or Wizard who commands you. Thus    BOOK  IV  DREADNAUGHT    45       47  Verse 4:0 ï¿½ a golden amputation  Wrath!  Behold the wrath of Oryx, coiled for ten thousand  years. Behold the Golden Amputation: the fall of  Taishibeth, the end of an age. We beat the worlds  of Taishibeth like skull drums and we howl in joy  for our black war moons as they ram silver  orbitals and gleaming star-webs, where infant  Taishibethi sun ravens curl and die unborn.  In his throne world Oryx paces ten times.  On the first pace, Kraghoor sends the accursed to  blight the Taishibethi worlds.  On the second pace, the Tai unleash their  battleplates and arsenal ships to fight our moons.  On the third pace, Oryxï¿½s Warpriest meets them  in battle, and he is victorious, he paints the void  with fire, he salts the earth with ash.  On the fourth pace, Mengoor and Craï¿½adug,  dyad knights, go to the Raven Bridge, and they  stand on it and kill the Tai for ten years.  On the fifth pace, the Tai Emperor Raven comes  home to her Bridge, and she cuts a moon with  her talons, she cuts it open and kills its brood.  On the sixth pace, Oryx speaks, saying, listen  to me, Emperor Raven, and I will describe to  you the Last True Shape, which is written on  my tablet. And he puts out his fist, full of black  fire, and he swallows up the Emperor Raven  with a wound.  Aiat! Only Oryx knows this power, the power  to take.  On the seventh pace, the Perfect Raven comes  out of Oryxï¿½s wound, and she spreads her  wings across Taishibeth. Never again is a  Taishibethi child born. She is perfect, she  enacts the will of Oryx.  On the eighth pace, the Tai say, listen, you are  spoilers, you are sphincters and excreta, you  rot, why do you kill? We made silver orbitals  and golden star webs. We hatched eggs. We  had a good thing. Our clothes were nice, our  food was famous. With one of her feathers our  Emperor could have tickled the gods.  On the ninth pace, Oryx says, this is the only  god, this ability to dictate what will and will  not exist, this power to go on existing. This is  your god. It is never ticklish.  On the tenth pace the Taishibethi are extinct.    Then Oryx says, listen my siblings, do you  know what we have done? We have  conquered our way to the edge of the Deep.  It whispers to me when I call on it, and it  guides my flight. It says that we are at its  threshold and that I should come inside.  Iwillgoandspeaktoit.

XXX:agoldenamputation    49  Verse 4:1 ï¿½ battle made waves  Oryx went down into his throne world. He went  out into the abyss, and with each step he read  one of his tablets, so that they became like stones  beneath his feet.  He went out and he created an altar and he  prepared an unborn ogre. He called on the  Deep, saying:  I can see you in the sky. You are the waves,  which are battles, and the battles are the waves.  Come into this vessel I have prepared for you.  And it arrived, the Deep Itself.   XXXI: battle made waves  Verse 4:2 ï¿½ Majestic. Majestic.  Oryx, my King, my friend. Kick back. Relax.  Shrug off that armor, set down that blade. Roll  your burdened shoulders and let down your  guard. This is a place of life, a place of peace.  Out in the world we ask a simple, true question.  A question like, can I kill you, can I rip your  world apart? Tell me the truth. For if I donï¿½t ask,  someone will ask it of me.  And they call us evil. Evil! Evil means ï¿½socially  maladaptive.ï¿½ We are adaptiveness itself.  Ah, Oryx, how do we explain it to them? The  world is not built on the laws they love. Not on  friendship, but on mutual interest. Not on  peace, but on victory by any means. The  universe is run by extinction, by extermination,  by gamma-ray bursts burning up a thousand  garden worlds, by howling singularities eating  up infant suns. And if life is to live, if anything  is to survive through the end of all things, it will  live not by the smile but by the sword, not in a  soft place but in a hard hell, not in the rotting  bog of artificial paradise but in the cold hard  self-verifying truth of that one ultimate arbiter,  the only judge, the power that is its own metric  and its own sourceï¿½existence, at any cost.  Strip away the lies and truces and delaying  tactics they call ï¿½civilizationï¿½ and this is what  remains, this beautiful shape.  The fate of everything is made like this, in the  collision, the test of one praxis against another.  This is how the world changes: one way meets  a second way, and they discharge their  weapons, they exchange their words and  markets, they contest and in doing so they  petition each other for the right to go on being  something, instead of nothing. This is the  universe figuring out what it should be in the  end.  And it is majestic. Majestic. It is the only thing  that can be true in and of itself.  And it is what I am.   XXXII: Majestic. Majestic.    50  Verse 4:3 ï¿½ When do monsters have dreams  Iï¿½m walking down the road, Iï¿½m going to the  orrery to talk to my dad, and I hear, well, I hear  this noise, so I look back. And my sisters are  behind me, and theyï¿½re ripping up the road.  Theyï¿½ve got these huge swords, execution swords,  and theyï¿½re levering the stones out of the road.  The stones are covered in writing. Theyï¿½re like  tablets. And thereï¿½s dirt underneath full of worms.  I need to get to the orrery before they catch up to  me so I start running but right away someone trips  me, itï¿½s my dad, heï¿½s got his foot out and he  grabs me by the horns and just slams me down  on my face. Iï¿½m in so much pain I nearly throw up  a worm.  ï¿½Why werenï¿½t you ready for this,ï¿½ dad says. Heï¿½s  wearing glare goggles, those shiny goggles that  heï¿½d use to save his vision during lightning storms  or sea fire. All three of his eyes reflect me. ï¿½Didnï¿½t  you know theyï¿½d be jealous, because they  couldnï¿½t come to the orrery and talk to me? Didnï¿½t  you know theyï¿½d move against you??ï¿½  I start wailing like Iï¿½m two days old again and I  say, Dad, I thought you were my friend, Iï¿½m  supposed to be safe here. But he just puts out his  fist and I realize heï¿½s laughing at me for believing  him, why did I think Iï¿½d be safe? In his fist heï¿½s  got a black sun and he holds me by the throat  and goes to tip the black sun inside me.  I can see my jaws in his goggles, three  reflections of my jaws with so many teeth.  So I start eating my dad. I bite huge pieces out  of him and I claw him up. I eat his legs and I  eat his arms and I eat his goggles and his eyes  and he says, good, good, this is majestic and  true.  But my sisters are still tearing up the road so I  donï¿½t know how to get back.   XXXIII: When do monsters have dreams  Verse 4:4 ï¿½ More beautiful to know  Sometimes I wonder if Iï¿½m a nihilist.  I donï¿½t do much except break things. Thatï¿½s  what they say about me: we couldï¿½ve had a  great civilization, if it werenï¿½t for that damn  Oryx, that damn Hive. They donï¿½t believe in  anything but death.  The only way to make something good is to  make something that canï¿½t be broken. And the  only way to do that is to try to break  everything.  Iï¿½m glad I learned that the universe runs on  death. Itï¿½s more beautiful to know.  But Iï¿½m lost somewhere strange.  I think that Savathï¿½n and Xivu Arath are trying    51  to steal the tablets from me. They must have cut  off my tribute while I was away communing with  the Deep. I love them so dearly. No one else is  clever or strong enough to try to break me. No  one else can give me this gift.  Once, long ago, I killed Xivu Arath on her war  moon, and she blew up the whole moon to kill  with me her. She was laughing in joy. I laughed  too. A whole moon! A whole moon. It was a  waste of a moon, but it taught me how to save  myself from exploding worlds, which was  necessary to fight the Ecumene.  I love mighty Xivu more than a moon loves the  tide. Iï¿½ll kill her for this. Over and over, forever  and ever.  When I get home from my wanderings in the  Deep, and I take back my throne, Iï¿½m going to  have children. Thatï¿½s what I need.  Sons and daughters to love and kill.   XXXIV: More beautiful to know  Verse 4:5 ï¿½ This Love Is War  Xivu upon Oryx ï¿½  Uttered by Xivu Arath ï¿½  Sibling of Oryx ï¿½  BETRAYAL. We have marooned Oryx within the  Deep. This is our obligation as lords of the Hive,  to make war upon each other, to eradicate  weakness and make ourselves sharp.  OBLIGATIONS. Once, I permitted Oryx to kill  me so that he could gain the sword logic and  overcome Akka our God. This left me trapped  deep in my throne. But Oryx my brother made  war upon the Ecumene and in that war he  described me, for I too am war. Thus I was  resurrected.  RESURRECTION. Savathï¿½n and I conspired to  strand Oryx on his expedition. But I secretly  believe that I will be stronger with Oryx to war  against. Thus I describe him.  A DESCRIPTION OF ORYX.  When Oryx looks upon you, you feel that you  may vanish if he looks away.  The crest of Oryxï¿½s skull is as long as an arm.  In the course of its life, a thought moves from  one end to the other. Upon his crest I have  painted a line in my blood, so that he will  remember me.  Each of Oryxï¿½s fangs has the precision of a  finger and the acuity of an eye.  Although he was born at the bottom of the  universe, and taught to burrow, Oryx has  grown wings. The light of wildfire shines  through them. Oryx teaches but he will not be  taught.    52  Oryxï¿½s body is corded with strength. His sinews  and his muscles are as strong as his children, and  his children are the strength of him.  Oryx wears a raiment of worm silk, made from  the caul of gods.  The voice of Oryx may cause two different  numbers to become equal.  Oryx my Brother is the bravest thing I know.  Upon Fundament he learned that we were the  natural prey of the universe, the most frail and  desperate of things. He thought about this  carefully and he found a way to fix it. He made  us strong. He will lead us into eternity.  Oryx my Brother loves me and this love is war.   XXXV: This Love is War  Verse 4:6 ï¿½ Eater of Hope  You are Crota, my son. Welcome.  I fought my way out of hell to make you. I fought  my traitor siblings and I fought the swarming  corpse of Akka and I cut my way back into my  own court, the High War, which had been  usurped. Once I had made war on Savathï¿½n, and  crippled her tribute so that she could never  challenge me, and once I had tricked Xivu Arath,  and poisoned her tribute so that she could never  again try to take my tablets, and once I had  arranged my own lineages so that I would be  greatest among the Hive and secure on my  throne ï¿½ then I found a mother to make  spawn.  One of those spawn was you.  Your life will be a battle too. You will have to  win your place at the High War. I will give you  nothing... except this, your first sword, and this  name I have prepared for you.  We fight a war against false hope, Crota. We  chase a god called the Traveler, a huckster  god who baits young life into building houses  for it. These houses are unsafe, for they cannot  stand against my Hive. And these houses are a  trap ï¿½ for they lead young life away from the  blade and the tooth, which are the tools of  survival and the means of ascension.  Only when the Traveler is extinguished will the  universe be free to arrange itself, and assume,  by ruthless contest, its final perfect shape, a  shape which depends on nothing but itself.  Thus I name you Crota, Eater of Hope.  There is an oath upon me, Crota my son, an  oath against the wretched Taox. This I do not  give to you. It is for me, your father, to bear.  Letï¿½s go meet your aunts and uncles.   XXXVI: Eater of Hope    53  Verse 4:7 ï¿½ shapes : points  Look at you!  Already you are grown, my daughter, already  you are a wizard. Have I been away so long?  Now you are Ir Anï¿½k, and Savathï¿½n cackles and  rages at your brilliance. You have written eleven  axioms describing the ascendant places, our  throne world. You have announced that you will  kill one of these axioms, as Akka would kill the  truth, and in mantling Akka you will become a  God, as I am.  If you try it I may kill you, or I may applaud.  Well done. I brought you this bitter acid for your  celebrations.  And you, Ir Halak, you are a wizard too, as is  the way of twins. I have been with Xivu Arath,  who complains that you have made a song,  and sung it in her throne world, and killed  everyone who listened, quite irrevocably. Will  we have songs instead of swords and  boomers?  What have you made for me? It is a tooth  shaped like death! I will keep it in my mouth.  What have you written for me? It is the course  of the Nicha Thought-ship! I will track it down.  I made you by cutting one larvae in half. It  would not die. Each half grew into one of you.  My sword is named Willbreaker, but it never  broke you.   XXXVII: shapes: points    54  Verse 4:8 ï¿½ The partition of death  One day Oryx decided to grow new wings.  While he wrestled with his worm, he came upon  his twin daughters dying in a wound between  places.  ï¿½What are you doing, my daughters?ï¿½ he asked.  He was afraid that Ir Halak and Ir Anï¿½k were  trying to go into the Deep, where only the Tablets  of Ruin allowed Oryx to go.  ï¿½We are dying, father,ï¿½ they said. ï¿½As many  times as we can manage.ï¿½  ï¿½Thatï¿½s adorably precocious.ï¿½ Oryx shook out his  new wings. ï¿½But why?ï¿½  ï¿½We propose a method by which Ascendant souls  can be detached and integrated into a  tautological and autonomous thanatosphere,  which we tentatively term an oversoul. Oversouls  can be stored in a throne world as a mechanism  of enhanced death resilience. As a side effect,  new refinements to our Deathsong may be  achieved, moving us closer to a generally  effective paracausal death impulse.ï¿½  Oryx brandished his sword. ï¿½Speak the Royal  Tongue, or Iï¿½ll pin you up for Eir to eat.ï¿½  ï¿½If we can separate our deaths from ourselves,  and hide them, we will be hard to kill.ï¿½  Oryx went to his son, Crota. ï¿½Go keep an eye  on your sisters,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½'You can learn  cunning from them.ï¿½  But while Oryx traveled to observe the Deep  destroy an ancient fortress world, Crota  conspired with his sisters to learn their secrets.  ï¿½I too will experiment with a wound,ï¿½ he said.  With his sword Crota cut open a new wound,  into a new space. In here he thought he might  obtain a secret power.  Out of this wound came machines called Vex.  They invaded Oryxï¿½s throne world.   XXXVIII: the partition of death  Verse 4:9 ï¿½ open your eye : go into it  The Vex clattered around, constructing large  problems. At first their constructions were  deranged, because they didnï¿½t understand the  sword logic, which defined all rules in Oryxï¿½s  throne world. The geometry perplexed them.  ï¿½Iï¿½ll cut them apart,ï¿½ Crota said. But just then,  the Vex ritual-of-better-thoughts manifested a  Mind called Quria, Blade Transform. Quria  deduced the sword logic.  I have to kill everything, Quria resolved. Then I  will be powerful.  Crotaï¿½s gate began to emit warrior Vex, huge  and brassy. He leapt forward to fight them, but    55  they blinked away. After they fled from Crota,  they killed two thousand of Oryxï¿½s Acolytes and  ten thousand of his Thrall. Soon they had  established themselves as powers in this world,  by right of slaughter.  ï¿½Come forth, sister wizards,ï¿½ called Ir Halak.  ï¿½We need you.ï¿½ Ir Anï¿½k pulled a sword star out  of the sky. Together the wizards charged it with  killing power and made an annihilator totem,  which they used to smash the Vex.  ï¿½Close the wound, brother Crota,ï¿½ Anï¿½k ordered.  ï¿½We will find a cunning way to destroy them, but  only after they stop constructing problems on us.ï¿½  But Quria had instanced itself to the other side of  the gate, and built a holdfast to keep the way  open. Quriaï¿½s objective was to exploit the  paracausal physics of Oryxï¿½s throne to become  divine. It organized a series of test invasions.  For a hundred years of local time the siblings  fought the Vex. When the Vex came into the  sword world, they were inevitably annihilated,  but when the Hive went into the Vex world, they  lost too much of their power to win.  ï¿½Fatherï¿½s going to eat our souls,ï¿½ Halak sighed.  Quria captured some worm larvae and began  experimenting with them. Soon Quria, Blade  Transform manifested religious tactics. By  directing worship at the worms, Quria learned  it could alter reality with mild ontopathogenic  effects. Being an efficient machine, Quria  manufactured a priesthood and ordered all its  subminds to believe in worship. Then it set  about abducting and killing dangerous  organisms so it could bootstrap itself to Hive  godhood. For some Vex reason, Quria never  attempted to introduce worm larvae into its  mind fluid.  Savathï¿½n was laughing, because she had  tricked Crota into cutting that place.  This drew the attention of the Worm our God.  ORYX, called Eir. SET YOUR HOUSE IN  ORDER.   XXXIX: open your eye : go into it    57  Verse 4:10 ï¿½ An Emperor For All Outcomes  Oryx rushed home and read from the Tablets of  Ruin. He put some of the Vex into wounds, to be  taken by the power of the Deep. Thus he turned  the Vex against each other. Quria manifested a  range of tactics, but none of them were  adaptive. Oryx crushed all the Vex in his throne.  Oryx thought that he should study geometry, like  the Vex. It was the map of perfect shapes. But  first he had to punish imperfection.  ï¿½My son,ï¿½ he said, ï¿½this is your punishment.  Come home glorious, or die forgotten!ï¿½ He  picked up Crota by the legs and threw him into  the Vex gate network.  Crota battled through history, becoming a  legendary demon. In his early centuries he often  spared a few victims to hear oaths and protests  against his father. Later, he came to understand  Oryx, and he made temples and monuments  wherever he went.  Meanwhile, Oryx brooded on the Vex. ï¿½Iï¿½ve met  a worthy rival,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½They want to exist  forever, just as I do. But I donï¿½t understand  them.ï¿½  At this his worm began to chew on him, for he  was bound to understand.  He called Savathï¿½n to meet in the material  world. She told him that the Vex worked  tirelessly to understand everything, so that they  could build a victory condition for every  possible end state of the universe.  ï¿½Then I must be a better king,ï¿½ Oryx said. ï¿½If  they want to build an emperor for all outcomes,  then I will be the king of only one. I will follow  the Deep wherever it goes, and document its  power. Let us create a catalog of the grave of  worlds, which will be our map to victory.ï¿½  Oryx knew that all life could be described as  cellular automata, except for that life which  understood the Deep or the Sky, and thus  escaped causality.  Out of love for her brother, which was the same  as the desire to kill him, Savathï¿½n leaked a  secret to Xivu Arath ï¿½ ï¿½listen, Xivu, Oryxï¿½s  throne world has been compromised. You can  cut your way in from here.ï¿½ Xivu Arath used this  to plan an ambush.  But Oryx was too canny. The Taken King said to  his Court, the High War, ï¿½My throne world is  vulnerable. I am going to move it.ï¿½  ï¿½Where?ï¿½ asked Kagoor, World-Render.  ï¿½Into a mighty dreadnaught,ï¿½ said Oryx. ï¿½I shall  keep my glorious mind cosmos inside a titanic  warship.ï¿½   XL: An Emperor For All Outcomes    58  Verse 4:11 ï¿½ Dreadnaught  To make his ship, Oryx scrimshawed one piece  of Akka, who was dead but far from gone. He  stole the Hammer of Xivu Arath and the Scalpel  of Savathï¿½n and he armored his ship in baneful  armor.  When Oryx had built his Dreadnaught, he  pushed his throne world inside out, so that it  bled into the material space of the Dreadnaught.  They were coterminous and allied, his ship and  his sin. The Dreadnaught was within the throne  of Oryx, but the throne of Oryx was the  Dreadnaught. Aiat!  This required a verse from the Tablets of Ruin.  The whole Court worked together to push Oryxï¿½s  throne inside out. This was a day of joyous  violence, and all of Oryxï¿½s broods mark this  holiday as Eversion Day, which is celebrated by  turning things inside out.  Sayeth Oryx,  Go out into the universe, my court  Gather tribute for me. Send it home to my ship.  When I call you, walk up that tribute to my  court.  I will prepare for long voyages ï¿½ [I am  Savathï¿½n, insidious]  Into the war ï¿½ [I graffiti this notice for you]  Into the Deep ï¿½ [These Books are full of lies!]  Now Oryxï¿½s throne was safe from incursion,  because it moved so nimbly.  Oryx attacked the Harmonious Flotilla Invincible,  who guarded the Nicha Thought-ship. When the  Flotilla surrounded his Dreadnaught, Oryx put  his sword into the hull, and he used the power  of the Deep (and the clever systems his  daughters built) to push his throne-world out into  mere reality.  By wrath and confidence he filled space with an  egg of his throne. It swelled up like a ghost star  to smash the Harmonious Flotilla Invincible.  Oryx broke the last word off their name.  In the Nicha Thought-ship, Oryx hoped to find  the location of the Gift Mast, which had been  left behind by the Traveler. Oryx wanted to eat  it.  But the Thought-ship was a trap. Upon it was  Quria, Blade Transform.

Thereï¿½s something pathological about the world  inside Oryxï¿½s ship. It resists analysis with hot,  dead spite. And Oryx himself, heï¿½s irreducible ï¿½  he refuses to obey Quriaï¿½s simulations, he  crashes around sowing chaos, he grabs  subminds and compromises them with some kind  of ontological weapon. Paracausal systems. Very  problematic.  Quriaï¿½s trying the religious tactics it evolved in  the Hive manifold. But even on those terms,  Oryx is strong, so strong. Quria wonï¿½t be able to  protect its gates much longer.  The closest Quriaï¿½s got to a simulation of Oryx is  a best-guess bootstrap. Itï¿½s wrong ï¿½ Quriaï¿½s sure  of that, itï¿½s Oryx minus the symbiote organism,  minus the wings and morphs, minus the weapon,  minus the power. No good for anything.  Quria manifests that simulation anyway. Just to  see what happens.  The Taken King marches on Quriaï¿½s Hydra-hull,  armed with blade and magic, cloaked in  ancient cloth, and the universe wails in horror  around him. Quriaï¿½s physics models and toy  worlds choke and crash.  Quria observes, alert and attentive, as a single  quark splits on the tip of Oryxï¿½s sword.  From within the Hydra-hull, Quriaï¿½s tiny not-Oryx  speaks. ï¿½What are you?ï¿½ it says. Itï¿½s manifesting  terror and awe.  Oryxï¿½s eyes blaze with a curiosity that is entirely  isomorphic with hate, with voracious hunger.  ï¿½Aurash,ï¿½ he says, in his Hive language.  ï¿½Youï¿½ve made me as I was. Youï¿½ve made a tiny  Aurash. Ha!ï¿½  Quria updates the simulationï¿½s name. Aurash is     62  curious: ï¿½Youï¿½re me? Youï¿½re me as I become?ï¿½  Oryx kneels. His blade is on his left shoulder.  Quria is firing every available weapon at him,  but his wards donï¿½t break. He looks into Quriaï¿½s  sensors through the hammering fire and he says,  ï¿½Child, I have everything you wanted. I am  immortal. I know the great secrets of the  universe. I have scouted the edges of the  Darkness and I have chased the lying god down  galactic arms in a howling pack of moons. In  my fist I carry the secret power that will rule  eternity. In my worm I bear the tribute of my  Court and of my children, the Hope-Eater, the  Weaver, and the Unraveler; and with this tribute  I smash my foes. I am Oryx, the Taken King. I  am almighty.ï¿½  Quria samples the Taox intelligence retrieved  from the Ecumene gate. There are useful names.  It feeds them to the simulation.  ï¿½What about your sisters?ï¿½ Aurash asks his  future self. ï¿½Sathona? Xi Ro? Are they with  you?ï¿½  The Taken Kingï¿½s fangs glint. That sound might  be a laugh, or a hiss.  Quria shuts down its weapons and puts all its  spare resources into sending telemetry to the  greater Vex. There will be points in space and  time where this data is vital. There will be great  projects undertaken in the study of this  ontological power, this throne-space.  ï¿½Where are my sisters?ï¿½ Aurash shouts. ï¿½What  have you done with my people? What have you  done?ï¿½  But Oryxï¿½s fist is full of black fire, and the next  thing Quria sees is a light like stars.   XLIII: End Of Failed Timeline    BOOK  V  DESTRUCTION  OF  HARMONY    64       65  Verse 5:2 ï¿½ strict proof eternal  ï¿½I have a gift for you,ï¿½ says Oryx.  Savathï¿½n, Witch-Queen, looks at him with dry  wariness. ï¿½Is it the sword logic I need to go into  the Deep, and take your power for myself?ï¿½  Their echoes move among the war-moons,  walking together on the hull of a two-thousandyear- old warship. Savathï¿½nï¿½s fleet has assembled  here, in preparation for an assault on the Gift  Mast. The Deep is headed that way, on the trail  of its prey, and the Hive will be its vanguard.  ï¿½Itï¿½s a Vex I captured. Quria, Blade Transform. It  made an attempt to puncture my throne. I thought  you might enjoy studying it.ï¿½ Oryx pauses,  digesting ï¿½ through the bond of lineage he can  feel Crota killing, worlds and worlds away, and it  tastes like sweet fat. ï¿½Quria contains a Vex  attempt to simulate me. It might generate others  ï¿½ you, perhaps, or Xivu Arath. Iï¿½ve left it some  will of its own, so it can surprise you.ï¿½  ï¿½I suppose itï¿½ll blow up and kill me,ï¿½ Savathï¿½n  grouses. ï¿½Or let the machines into my throne,  where theyï¿½ll start turning everything into clocks  and glass.ï¿½  ï¿½If it kills you, then you deserve to die.ï¿½ Oryx  says it with a quiet thrill, a happy thrill, because it  is good to say the truth.  ï¿½I donï¿½t have a strict proof yet, you know.ï¿½  Savathï¿½n strokes the void with one long claw  and space-time groans beneath her touch.  ï¿½This thing we believe ï¿½ that weï¿½re liberating  the universe by devouring it, that weï¿½re cutting  out the rot, that weï¿½re on course to join the  final shape ï¿½ I havenï¿½t found a strict, eternal  proof. We might yet be wrong.ï¿½  Oryx looks at her and for a moment, just a  moment, he is nostalgic, he is sentimental. He  thinks, imagine the years behind us, the things  weï¿½ve done. And yet being old doesnï¿½t feel like  a scar, does it? It hasnï¿½t left me dull. I feel  alive, alive with you, and every time I step  back into this world from my throne I feel like  Iï¿½m two years old again, at the bottom of the  universe, looking up.  But he says, ï¿½Sister, itï¿½s us. Weï¿½re the proof, we  the Hive: if we last forever, we prove it, and if  something more ruthless conquers us, then the  proof is sealed.ï¿½  She looks back at him with eyes like hot  needles. ï¿½I like that,ï¿½ she says. ï¿½Thatï¿½s  elegant.ï¿½ Although of course she has had this  thought before.   XLIV: strict proof eternal    66  Verse 5:3 ï¿½ I'd shut them all in cells.  Prey and Sacrifice ï¿½  Uttered by Xivu Arath ï¿½  God of War ï¿½  HARMONY. When the Traveler passed across  Harmony, it lied to the orbits of ten worlds. Now  they orbit the black hole. The Traveler lied to the  accretion disc, so that it would give warm light to  these worlds.  THE GIFT MAST. When the Traveler left Harmony,  it made a monument out of the black holeï¿½s polar  jet. In the jet there is a hollow mast which sings in  radiance. This is the Gift Mast and we will  devour it, we will eat the Sky out of it, we will  snap it like a bone.  THE HARMONY STING. The Harmony have  weaponized their dead star. They can stimulate  the accretion disc to fire relativistic plasma jets.  We will take the Sting. We will use it to burn their  worlds. I will grant one temple of tribute to the  first Ascendant to kill a world!  ORYX. I will have the Gift Mast to feast on! I will  have it first! I am Xivu Arath and all war is my  temple. Beware the daughters of Oryx, for they  make and unmake with ease.  SAVATHï¿½N. The Deceitful Sister will be distracted  by arcana and the song of the black hole. Treat  her broods with contempt.  THE TRAVELER. We chase it and we will  devour it. The Deep will rule the cosmos.  THE DRAGONS. Our gods should be ours  alone. Their smug freedom is an insult to me.  Iï¿½d shut them all in cells. Bring them to me!   XLV: I'd shut them all in cells  Verse 5:4 ï¿½ The Gift Mast  The Gift Mast!  It towers above this star system like a  monument to treason. It beams with silver light.  It sings a radio lullaby, made of soothing lies.  In its light live the Harmony, and they are now  our prey.  Now arrives Xivu Arath, at the head of her  armada. She fights the Harmony for fifty years  with strategies and discipline. But the Harmony  turn to dragon-wishes, and their wishful  bishops wrestle Xivu in the ascendant plane.  Xivu falls into deadlock.  Next arrives Savathï¿½n, flanked by her chorus  and her celebrants. They trick their way onto  Ana-Harmony in disguises, so that they might    67  vivisect these dragons. The Worm our God  laughs and laughs.  For a hundred years Savathï¿½n keeps secret  covens among the Harmony.  But first of all was Oryx, whose brood grew in  secret places in the rubble of the accretion disc.  The First Navigator sends rocks and comets to  crash into the Harmony worlds, so that the  Harmony fleet will be disarrayed. He sends  seeders to infiltrate the Harmony worlds with his  broods.  Here at the center of the fifth book the Hive has  grown so mighty that it has made the  annihilation of all false life routine.  Xivu Arath kills the wishful bishops, and  Savathï¿½n achieves some secret purpose, and  Oryxï¿½s Court tears down the Gift Mast. The  Harmony people wail in terror, and they throw  themselves into the silver lakes of Ana-Harmony  to drown.  ï¿½Come,ï¿½ sayeth Oryx, ï¿½eat of the Gift Mast, for I  am a generous god. Of its pieces, I claim only  two out of every five.ï¿½  The Mast is full of the Light of the Traveler, it is  full of the marrow taste of Sky. All who eat of it  are filled with the ecstatic certainty that they  serve a great and necessary purpose.  Then sayeth Savathï¿½n, ï¿½Siblings, listen, we  must part ways a while, so that we may grow  different.ï¿½ She flies her war-moons into the  black hole. Her throne becomes distant.  Sayeth Xivu Arath, ï¿½King Oryx, you take up too  much space, your power constrains too many  choices. I must go away from you.ï¿½ She flies  her war-moons away into the night. Her throne  is barred shut.  Then Oryx was alone. He spent a while in  thought, and those thoughts are recorded here.   XLVI: The Gift Mast    68  Verse 5:5 ï¿½ Apocalypse Refrains  This is our message to the things that we will kill.  A species which believes that a good existence  can be invented through games of civilization  and through laws of conduct is doomed by that  belief. They will die in terror. The lawless and the  ruthless will drag them down to die. The universe  will erase their monuments.  But the one that sets out to understand the one  true law and to perform worship of that law will  by that decision gain control over their future.  They will gain hope of ascendance and by their  ruthlessness they will assist the universe in arriving  at its perfect shape.  Only by eradicating from ourselves all clemency  for the weak can we emulate and become that  which endures forever. This is inevitable. The  universe offers only one choice and it is between  ruthlessness and extinction.  We stand against the fatal lie that a world built  on laws of conduct may ever resist the action of  the truly free. This is the slavery of the Traveler,  the crime of creation, in which labor is wasted on  the construction of false shapes.  If you choose to fight us, fight us with everything  you have, with all your laws and games. We will  prove our argument thus.   XVLII: Apocalypse Refrains  Verse 5:6 ï¿½ aiat, aiat, aiat, aiat, aiat  All is well. Aiat: what is at war is healthy, what  is at peace is sick.  My son Crota feeds me rich, rich tribute. My  lineages are strong, my worm is vast and  satiated, and with that security I can spend my  time on study and communion with the Deep.  As I learn more secrets, my power grows; as  my power grows I use it to learn more secrets.  Aiat: let it be thus because it must.  I wonder if my sisters have secrets of their own.  If my power exceeds theirs I may kill them  permanently and subsume their thrones. But I  think they have strength that they hide from me,  developed in time of separation. Aiat: the only  meaningful relationship is the attempt to  destroy.  Savathï¿½n asks if I am as much a slave of the  Deep as my Taken. She asks what price I pay  for my power. I am not Taken. The Hive is not  the Deep. The Deep doesnï¿½t want everything to  be the same: it wants life, strong life, life that  lives free without the need for a habitat of  games to insulate it from reality. When I make  my Taken I make them closer to perfect, I heal  their wounds and enhance their strengths. This  is inherently good. Aiat: the only right is  existence, the only wrong is nonexistence.  I am Oryx, the First Navigator, the Taken King.    69  Aiat: let me be what I am because to be anything  else would be fatal.   XVLIII: aiat, aiat, aiat, aiat  Verse 5:7 ï¿½ Forever And A Blade  I considered returning to Fundament. Learning  what became of the God-Wave, and the Tungsten  Monoliths, and the continents which were all that  remained of my peopleï¿½s primal home.  But I know what became of all that. It became  me. I am the heir of Fundament, the immortal  descendant of those ten-year krill. I asked a  question: how can we live in the universe long  enough to understand it?  And I learned the answer, which is written here in  this book. I learned that I had to become most  ruthless of all.  I donï¿½t know where the Darkness-which-is-the-  Deep came from, nor the Traveler that I hunt. But I  will learn. I will learn.  This is my inheritance, my estate: eternity, infinity,  the whole universe beneath my sword. This is  what I rule: forever and a blade.   XLIX: Forever And A Blade  Verse 5:8 ï¿½ Wormfood  What will happen if I die?  It suits me to consider this, for I am a great ally of  death. My daughters study the quiddity of  death, my son practices the inhabitation of  death, and my great work is, in ultima, to  become synonymous with death, to die and in  that dying live, so that if the universe comes to  nothing then I will be a part of that nothing.  Far better to have a savage universe with a  happy end than a happy universe with no  hope.  I have died many times but these deaths were  only temporary.  If my echoes are killed, and I am killed in the  material world, then I will be driven back to  my throne the Dreadnaught. If my Court and  my throne can be beaten, if I am confronted in  my throne, if I am defeated there, then I will  die. My work will end.  This is the pact to which I am bound, in  particular by my study of the Tablets of Ruin,  and by my use of the power of the Deep.  When I call upon that power, I put myself up  as the stakes in a wager, I gamble with my  soul. For I am saying, listen, my gods, I am the  mightiest thing there is, and I prove it thus.  Lately I have realized how much I depend on  Crota and my daughters, and even upon my  court. If I lost them, my outlays would exceed  my intakes, my tribute would not be enough to  feed my worm. But this is proper ï¿½ for if I lost    70  them it would be because they were not mighty  enough, and then I would be a bad father, a bad  King. I must test them and fight with them, to keep  them strong. This is my geas.  I will go on forever. I will understand everything.  There is only one path and that is the path that  you make. But you can make more than one path.  Break your cellï¿½s bars. Make a new shape, make  the shape from its path, find your cellï¿½s bars,  break out of the bars, find a shape, make the  shape from its path, eat the light, eat the path.  If I fail, let me be wormfood.   L: Wormfood  Verse 5:9 - I'll Make Sure.  I have made preparations.  If I am defeated I know it will be because my  understanding of the universe was incomplete. I  failed to anticipate some strategy, some nemesis.  (Perhaps Taox, if she still lives.) If I am defeated, I  know that I will fall to something mighty.  Something that craves might, something that loves  what I love, which is the Deep, a principle and a  power, the versatile, protean need to adapt and  endure, to reach out and shape the universe  entirely for that purpose, to mutate and redesign  and test and iterate so that it can prevail, can  seize existence and hold it, certain that this is  everything, that there is nothing to life except  living. And it has two faces, yet it is one  shape. One face is the objective, which is  obvious, and the other face is that will to  sacrifice things and ideas for a single mission,  the mission of becoming the shape, a shape  that will not relent, the utter commitment to  survival, to draw the right sword and choose  where to cut: to allow this hunger to become  your weapon.  So I will prepare a book, which is a map to a  weapon. And my vanquisher will read that  book, seeking the weapon, and they will come  to understand me, where I have been and  where I was going. And then they will take up  my weapon, and they will use it, they will use  that weapon, which is all that I am.  And armed thus with my past, and my future,  and my present (which is a weapon, a  weapon that takes whatever is available, a  weapon bound to malice), they will mantle me,  Oryx, the Taken King.  They will become me and I will become them,  each of us defeating the other, correcting the  other, alloying ourselves into one omnipotent  philosophy. Thus I will live forever.  Iï¿½ll make sure.
